we've got a killing team on a mission.
They're killing sinners.
In control enough to do complicated computer work.
I'm pretty sure it's a video of your mr.
Carr being murdered.
There's a video of this murder posted on the internet? - Those 3 dogs attacked someone a couple of months ago.
- Think the owners are there? Hi.
Mr.
Hankel? There's a report that lists you as calling 911.
You were walking your dog.
That's wrong.
I don't have a dog.
Jj,it's him! It's the guy,jj! He's the unsub! He's in the barn.
Come on.
You cover the front.
I'll go around back.
Hotch knows we're missing.
He'll come looking for us.
We'll just wait tobias out.
Jj! - I tried to warn everyone.
- Ok.
Shoot him! Shoot him,you weakling.
He's a satan.
Johan, follow me.
Take the Hotch and Gideon.
I'm a man of wealth and taste there's a barn around back.
Prentiss,come on.
Danm F.
B.
I.
! - Jj! - Don't move! Jj,it's morgan and prentiss.
Don't shoot.
It's ok.
Are you hurt? Tobias hankel is the unsub.
Yeah,we know.
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- Yeah We just thought he was a witness.
- I had to kill them.
- Jj,where's reid? They just completely tore her apart.
- There's nothing even left- - jj,look at me.
Look at me.
Where's reid? We split up.
He said he was going to go in the back.
House is clear.
So where the hell is he? - hey,is there any sign of him yet? - We got every one of our units on the road.
He won't make it far.
You can't find reid? Not yet.
Prentiss.
I think reid followed him into the cornfield.
It looks like somebody got dragged.
Yeah.
You sure? - We're on our way now.
- Hey,what's going on? The sheriff 2 towns over.
He just gave directions to a man who fit hankel's description.
It's to a motor lodge in fort bend.
- Let's get hotch and gideon.
- Yeah.
why are we driving so far? Because if you want to feel close to god,sometimes you got to make the journey.
When you start hunting on your own,you find yourself a place where you're at peace.
It's a powerful thing,taking an animal's life.
You got to be right with yourself.
But I don't want to kill anything.
Stop that lip quivering and sit up.
We're almost there.
they're gone.
Who are they? It's just me now.
Who who are you? I'm raphael.
- What's that smell? - They're burning fish hearts and livers.
Keeps away the devil.
They believe you can see inside men's minds.
It's not true.
I study human behavior.
I'm not interested in the arguments of men.
You know that this is? It's god's will.
- You don't have to do this.
- Now go,sinners,to your god.
There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.
Ecclesiastes 7:20.
You know,they do have hotels in georgia.
If we're going to figure out where tobias hankel has taken reid,the answer is in this house.
There's no sense splitting time between here and a field office.
Right.
Think of the house as a witness.
If it could talk,what would it tell us? My guess is it would tell us to get the hell out.
Welcome to our nightmare.
His computer is an extension of his brain.
I need you to dissect it.
I'll get you set up.
Come on.
So,nothing new since I left? Well,the good thing is,the guy documented practically every second of his life.
The bad news is,we're still unpiling.
From the looks of it,he hasn't left this place in years.
He knew he could pretend to be looking for a motel and throw us off his trail.
No,no,no.
It's more than that.
Sheriff's office,911 calls.
Every time he engages the police and gets away with it he reassures himself god's on his side, not ours.
Right out of the gate,the guy's self-taught.
His mainframe is totally idiosyncratic,but it's pretty brilliant.
Talk to me about what this son of a bitch watches on-line.
What the hell is all of this? It's tame stuff- video games,software,sports.
Seriously,if I had to guess whose system this belongs to,I would say a crazy smart high-school kid.
- Garcia,that doesn't make any sense.
- Well,that's what I've got.
A mission-based killer like hankel would need constant reassurance- religious manifesto,violent images,something.
Nothing,baby.
Nothing.
What about the mpegs of the murders he posted on-line? Does he sit and watch those over and over? - Ok,that's weird.
- What?Talk to me.
They're not even here.
All I have is a site he set up once he commandeered people's webcams,and he keeps a running clock, and at a certain point,each one is bookmarked with a different heading.
"Adulterer, liar, thief.
" This guy sits here for days and just watches these people,and he waits for them to commit a sin.
Yeah,but reid's completely innocent.
If you dig deep enough on any of us,we all have our sins,including reid.
including reid.
What are you staring at,boy? You're not raphael.
Do I look like raphael? Thank you for burning those keeping us safe.
- Don't try to trick me.
- I would never try and trick you.
- You're a liar.
- I'm not a liar.
- Lying's a sin.
- I'm not a liar.
This will be over quickly if you just confess your sins.
I'm not a sinner.
We're all sinners.
The lord spake unto moses saying,"speak unto all the congregation of the children of the lord " and say unto them,ye shall be holy,for I,the lord your god,am holy.
- You know leviticus.
- I know every word of the bible.
I can recite it for you.
The devil knows how to read,too.
I'm not a devil.
I'm not a devil.
I'm a man.
My name is spencer reid,and I have a mother,and I have a father just like you,and they taught me the bible.
and I have a father,just like you,and they taught me the bible.
Let me just recite the bible.
Time to confess,spencer reid.
Confess.
I I don't have anything to confess.
Hey,I have got a list of narcotics anonymous meetings.
Someone's name and number is written on it, but this looks to be about 12 years old.
Try it.
There are no bad leads.
Is that latin? Honora patrum tuum.
"Honor thy father.
" Hey,hey,hey.
Jj,it's me.
Are you all right? Uh yeah.
I'm sorry.
You scared me.
I'm sorry.
I'm talking tomorrow morning to some guy who knew hankel from narcotics anonymous.
Why don't you come with me,get out of the house? Yeah.
Ok.
Great.
Emily.
Yeah? How come none of this gets to you? What do you mean? You came off a desk job.
Now suddenly you're in the field surrounded by mutilated bodies,and you don't even flinch.
She's right.
You've never blinked.
I guess maybe i compartmentalize better than most people.
Hey,guys! I think I got something! Tobias hankel! F.
B.
I.
! Tobias hankel.
Tobias.
I think we just found hankel's father.
You need to eat.
What's your name? Tobias.
Tobias? Who was here before? It was probably my father.
I'm sorry if he hurt you.
What are you doing? Don'T.
Please don'T.
It helps.
Don't tell my father.
He doesn't know they're here.
Please.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
Please.
Trust me.
I know.
Spencer,please go to the other room.
Don't treat him like a child.
I'm not going to have this conversation in front of him.
Statistically,children who grow up in 2-parent households attain 3 more years of higher education than children from single-parent households.
attain 3 more years of higher education than children from single-parent households.
We're not statistics,spencer.
I'm not crazy.
If you refuse to take care of yourself,I can't help you.
I do take care of myself.
What day is it? That's not fair.
I'm out of ideas,diana.
Well,you could take spencer with you,just for a little while.
- Don't do this.
- You're weak.
You're right.
Good-bye.
I'm not weak.
I know,honey.
I'm not weak.
I'm not weak.
I don't give a damn whether you're weak or strong.
Yell all you want,boy.
Ain't no one gonna hear you where you are.
The coroner put charles hankel's death at approximately 6 months ago.
Ok,that's got to be the stressor.
Stressor? His father's death- it's probably what set him off.
What we need to do is focus on that time period,see what was going on in his life,and maybe we can get a key to where he's hiding now.
Tobias hankel.
I haven't thought about that boy in probably 10 years.
So you two were in a program together? He should tell you,but yeah,I was his sponsor.
Small town.
We all get lumped together.
Me,I was just a drunk,but tobias,he was a whole different sort of animal.
but tobias,he was a whole different sort of animal.
So,what was tobias' drug of choice? Dilaudid.
Drugstore heroin.
He used to cut it with a psychedelic.
That boy was looking to escape as far from reality as he could get.
Addicts don't get excuses,but if someone ever needed to self-medicate,it was that boy.
but if someone ever needed to self-medicate,it was that boy.
- Why is that? - You know anything about his daddy? We think tobias hankel may have murdered his father.
Good for him.
You know,tobias' mama ran off with another man when he was 7.
His dad went section-eight,started preaching about sin,end-of-the-world stuff.
started preaching about sin,end-of-the-world stuff.
He beat tobias silly.
He burned a cross in his forehead when tobias was 10.
If tobias wore a hat,he beat him more.
Is there anyone tobias would turn to if he was on the run? As far as I know,he never left home.
You know,honestly,between his habit and the old man, I'm amazed he's still alive.
There's something weird going on here.
- You think? - No,seriously.
Check this out.
This journal is filled with religious ramblings.
He notates hour by hour.
"November if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offering unto the lord,ye shall offer it at your own will.
" And it goes on and on.
5:04,7:41,10:22,1:42.
But then it goes blank for days.
Maybe he got sick of writing.
- I think I got it.
- What is it? Journal entry- "december "Wants me to put him down.
"I say,"thou shalt not kill.
He says,honor thy father.
Must pray for guidance.
" So he kills his father as an act of mercy? This is 2 months ago.
Tobias hankel's father had been dead for 4 months already.
That's exactly it.
Look at the floor.
These scuff marks are fresh.
I mean,it's like 2 people were moving the chairs constantly,trying to fight for control.
So? This journal matches charles hankel's handwriting.
But it was written after he died.
Upstairs,tobias' bedroom- it's got junk piled from floor to ceiling,but the other bedroom could pass a military inspection.
So are you telling me one of tobias' personalities was his father? Well,tobias was raised with a strict religious code- black and white,right and wrong.
When his father asked tobias to kill him,something had to give.
His brain couldn't handle the moral contradiction, so it split into 2 personalities in order to keep his father alive.
So who is raphael? My guess-he's a mediator between the two.
Angels have no human emotions.
Live or die,they don't care,as long as it's god's will.
We need to start profiling tobias' father.
He may be the one who chose where to take reid.
I'll get garcia on it.
Garcia,I need you to log into the system as tobias' father.
The system was set up 3 months ago.
Dad was already dead.
I know that,smarty-pants,but do it for your boy anyway,all right? Ok.
Charles hankel.
Oh.
- Are you ready,boy? - Ready for what? My weakling son thinks god gave you to him for a reason.
Let's see if we're both right.
Any luck with the rehab contact? Well,he has no idea where hankel might be, but we did learn that he has a serious drug problem- dilaudid.
Well,that could explain the psychotic fracture.
- What are you talking about? - Tobias is living as at least 3 different people- himself,raphael, and his father.
This could be some bad news.
A computer store was robbed in the middle of the night.
A suburb outside of atlanta.
The thief got away with 4 laptops, external hard drives, and a satellite.
If it's tobias,it puts him right back in business.
- What happened? - I don't know.
Oh,my god.
Guys! Guys! Get in here! He's been beaten.
Can't you track him? Hankel's only streaming this to his home computer.
This is for us.
He knows we're herE.
- I'm gonna put this guy's head on a stick.
- Why can't you locate him? He's rerouting to a different I.
P.
Address every 30 seconds.
I can't track him.
Can you really see inside men's minds? See these vermin? Choose one to die.
I'll let you choose one to live.
No.
I thought you wanted to be some kind of savior.
You're a sadist and a psychotic break.
You won't stop killing.
Your word's not true.
The other heathens are watching.
Choose a sinner to die,and I'll say the name and address of the person to be saved.
I won't get choose who gets slaughtered and have you leave their remains behind like a poacher.
Can you really see into my mind,boy? Can you see I'm not a liar?! Choose one to die,and save a life.
Otherwise,they're all dead.
- All right,i'll choose who lives.
- They're all the same.
Far right screen.
Marilyn david,4913 walnut creek road.
- You got that? - Yeah.
Hello.
Marilyn david,my name is jason gideon.
I'm with the F.
B.
I.
What? Raphael.
You've done your part.
Now it's my turn.
So now what? Wait for a 911 call,and hope we get there in time? - Red or white? - White.
All right.
Honey,did you leave the drawer open? - 911.
What's your emergency? - 3514 leavenworth.
Raphael has killed them before their lies can free more sinners.
Thanks,D.
C.
Slaughtered,same as the others.
We've got roadblocks for a 15-mile radius.
Every unit's on the road.
But so far nothing.
I don't know how much longer reid can hold out.
Who were the victims? Pam and mike hayes.
He was a local defense attorney.
- And what bible passage was left? - Isaiah 59.
"No one calls for justice,"no one pleads their case with integrity.
They rely on empty arguments,they utter lies they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
Reid,if you're watching, you're not respensible for this.
you understand me? He's perverting god to justify murder.
You are stronger than him.
He cannot break you.
I thought you were going to try and get some rest.
Everybody else is working.
I should be,too.
We can handle it.
It's funny.
I keep thinking the one thing we need to crack this case is,uh well,reid.
Yeah.
You think reid and i should have stayed together at the barn,don't you? Jj,go get some rest.
I can tell that's what you're thinking,so - I just want to get reid home safe.
- But if I had his back,like I was supposed to,he'd be here now.
- Jj,what do you want from me? - I just I want someone to tell me the truth.
The truth is one of you is here,and one of you isn'T.
You got to figure the rest out for yoursF.
We're not getting any closer.
Reid's brilliant.
He'll figure out how to survive.
You know,I always take advantage of reid for his brain, but I never actually teach him how to deal with things emotionally.
- Lead by example.
- What kind of example is that? He'll make it.
Tobias.
Sorry.
I had to leave for a while.
You can leave again,and you can take me with you.
- My father would be angry.
- Not if he can't find us.
- He always finds me.
- If you tell me where we are, my friends will come,and they'll save us.
We can't be saved.
We can.
We can.
I promise.
If you tell me where we are,I'll save us both.
Listen to me.
It's not worth fighting.
Tell me it doesn't make it better.
Mom.
- What is it,baby? - It's the afternoon.
I'm resting.
The doctor says you need to get out of bed.
I've been reading.
He says you need exercise.
Well,that's because his idea of good literature is "our bodies,our selves.
- Well,he's your doctor.
- He's a neanderthal.
- Where are you going? - I'm going to see if jeff wants to play.
Come here.
Let me read to you.
Up,up.
Pick one.
that one.
Proust.
Beautiful choice.
"The smell of the madeleine unleashing the flood of memory.
"for a long time,I used to go to bed early.
"Sometimes,when I had put out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say to myself, I'm falling asleep.
" Any more sign of reid? And he just posted the last murder on-line.
It's had over 17,000 hits in the first 20 minutes.
- I want to see it.
- No,you don'T.
Don't tell me what I want and don't want.
If I can't watch this I have no business being in the field.
Jj,it's not a competition.
I I need to see it.
If you stop being affected by things,you lose parts of yourself,you know.
Show me.
I won't watch it with you.
Raphael has killed them before their lies can free more sinners.
We can trace their whole family history.
Here we got happy,smiling pictures of tobias.
Report cards all a's and b's,but at 8 years old,we got nothing.
That's his mother leaving.
other side of the board, we have a form from child services saying they paid a visit.
Then charles starts keeping journals about punishing sinners and needing to remove the devil from his son.
Which corresponds to tobias' drug use.
He's trying to escape.
So wherever reid is,it was tobias' choice,not his father'S.
- How do you figure? - Look at these 2 lives.
They're like inverse graphs.
One's getting weaker while the other one's getting angrier.
Tobias would run away.
His father would have stood and fought.
Ok,so tobias uses drugs as an escape.
I'll go back through the journals and see if I can find anything connecting his drug use to a hiding place.
Uh where's gideon? He's upstairs.
Why? What's going on? Hankel just posted the latest murder.
I don't understand.
Why can't we shut it down?Because I can't pioint his I.
P.
F.
- Just remove it once he sends it.
- It's the internet,sir.
Once something's out there,you can never take it back.
It must remain.
You can't undo anything.
Can you please do something,anything? I do not want him thinking he has a pulpit.
I have a list of everyone from the file-sharing chain.
I could send out a mass warning that the video is actually a virus.
I'm gonna do that.
Ok.
No.
No! They're trying to silence my message.
I can't control what they do.
I'm not with them.
I'm with you.
Really? Reid,if you're watching, you're not responsible for this.
You understand me? He's perverting god to justify murder.
You are stronger than him.
He cannot break you.
Do you think you can defy me? - I don't know what he's talking about.
- You're a liar! You're pitiful! Just like my son.
This ends now.
Confess your sins.
- Confess! - I haven't done anything.
- Tobias,help mE.
- He can't hp you.
He's weak.
Tobias.
Confess your sins.
Help.
oh my god.
He's killing him.
It's the devil vacating your body.
You was a sinner.
You haven't proven that.
They all are in the end.
You did the right thing.
You had to stop the video.
You did the right thing.
There's no question.
God gave him to me for a reason.
Your work is done.
I can save him.
How? By breathing a killer's breath into his body? JasoN.
Wait.
Wait a second.
- When was the video of the last murder posted? - 9:23.
And what was the time of death? The 911 call came in at 9:04,and the murder must have been moments later.
That's only a 19-minute difference.
How long would it take to post the mpeg? - 2 or 3 minutes.
- Let's call it 2.
You figure a maximum of 60 miles an hour in a residential area.
That means hankel has to be within a 17-mile radius of the crime scene.
Garcia,can we see it on a map? Call farraday.
I want that area locked down like it's martial law.
Guys.
You came back to life.
Raphael.
There can be only one of two reasons.
I was given C.
P.
R.
There are no accidents.
How many members are on your team? The 7 angels who had the 7 trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
The first sounding followed hail and they were thrown to earth.
He thinks it's revelations- the 7 archangels versus the 7 angels of death.
- Tell me who you serve.
- I serve you.
- Then choose one to die.
- What? Your team members- choose one to die.
Kill me.
- You said you weren't one of them.
- I lied.
Your team has 6 other members.
Tell me who dies.
No.
Choose,and prove you'll do god's will.
No.
Choose.
I won't do it.
Life is a choice.
No.
Choose.
I I choose aaron hotch.
He's a classic narcissist.
He thinks he's better than everyone else on the team.
Genesis 23:4.
"Let him not deceive himself "and trust in emptiness,vanity,falseness,and futility,for these shall be his recompense.
in emptiness,vanity,falseness,and futility, for these shall be his recompense.
For god's will.
- I'm not a narcissist.
- Come on.
Look.
You can't think anything from that.
- He's not in his right mind,hotch.
- No.
Stop.
Stop.
All right,everybody right now- what's my worst quality? Ok.
I'll start.
I have no sense of humor.
- You're a bully.
- I'm a bully.
- You can be a drill sergeant sometimes.
- Right.
- You don't trust women as much as men.
- Ok,good.
I'm all these things,but none of you said that I ever put myself above the team,because I don't,ever.
Reid and I argued about the definition of classic narcissism, and he knew that I would remember that,and he also quoted genesis,chapter 23,verse 4.
Read it.
"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you.
" Give me property,forbear a place among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
" He wouldn't get it wrong unless it was on purpose.
He's in a cemetery.
- I don't see a cemetery.
- Call up the first time we saw reid.
I won't choose who gets slaughtered and have you leave their remains behind like a poacher.
Check to see if there are any reports of poaching in the last couple of days.
Ok.
Uh a farmer reported 2 sheep being slaughtered on his property.
Where are we talking? - What's that patch of green there? - Marshall parish.
- I think it's an old plantation.
- Wait.
Tobias wrote in his journals about staying clean and keeping away from marshall.
Guys,there's a cemetery on the grounds.
Tobias,is that you? Thank you.
You saved my life.
I'm sorry.
Why? He'll win in the end.
Tobias,I need to know something.
It's important.
Are we in a cemetery? Yeah.
I used to come here to get high.
I was righT.
No one bothers you here.
I never told anyone about it.
What are these men doing here? They're from a hospital.
They're here to help.
I don't need help,and you can't be here without permission.
and you can't be here without permission.
Tell them,spencer.
I called them.
Spencer.
- I'm doing this for you.
- This isn't legal.
Your son's 18,ma'am.
He can act in your welfare.
You need help.
I want to stay here.
I'm sorry.
Please,these are my things.
This is my life.
I'm sorry.
Spencer,please don't do this to me.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
What are you sorry for,boy? I sent her away.
Who? My mom.
I couldn'T I couldn't help her.
Is that a confession? I confess.
You know your bible.
Exodus 21:17.
"And he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
" Grab a shovel.
I ought to bury you alive in there, give you time to think about what you done.
- I know what I've done.
- Don't talk back to me.
Dig.
Go! F.
B.
I.
! Clear.
Clear.
Oh! What's that smell? Let's spread out.
They have to be on foot.
Let's go! What are you stopping for? Dig faster! - I'm not strong enough.
- You're all weak! Get out of there.
Only one bullet in that gun,boy.
Reid! Over there.
You killed him.
Tobias? Do you think I'll get to see my mom again? I'm sorry.
Reid.
You all right? I knew you'd understanD.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
It wasn't your fault.
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.
Please can I have a second alone?
