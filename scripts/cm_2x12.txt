isn't gonna be a hole deep enough to bury your career What's wrong with you,man You know I'm an fbi agent Well,then you should be fairly aware of your rights Do you want a lawyer I'm not some punk kid you can scare anymore,gordinski Tough guy you want a lawyer Yes or no I want a phone call Local I need to call my supervisor at fbi headquarters in quantico Agent hotchner He's already getting a call There has to be a mistake Yes Of course We're on our way This is ssa hotchner, I need an emergency recall of agents reid,prentiss,jareau and penelope garcia as well Yeah-uh,yes,I'll call him myself,thank you Jason,it's hotch,we've got to get to chicago,morgan's been arrested Homicide Righ I can wait as long as you guys can Did you get some sleep You know I didn'T Slept like a baby,myself Didn't even wanna get out of bed Really So that wasn't your donut-eatin' ass on the other side of that glass all night,then,huh Here you go You want the other ones No,just this one right now Come on,man You gotta be kidding me,right Pretend you went home and slept,put an empty box with my name on it on a table right in front of me The fbi invented this stuff,you simple bastard We teach it What's this It's yesterday You're following me Whose grave is that Why would you be following me Whose grave You know I don't know his name You paid to bury him,didn't you The neighborhood did But you led the collection So And you visit him a lot Every time I come home Is there something wrong with that What,you got a crush on me all of a sudden,gordinski Ok,that's me at the youth center tossing a ball around with a couple of kids You did a little more than that This is about you giving one of them a ride home,one of the boys Yeah Yeah,I did This kid named,um,damien His place was on the way to my mother'S So what,man Damien walters,D O A Oh,no Somebody killed him Not somebody,derek You think I did this Special agent hotchner,fbi I'm looking for detective gordinski I got this,chuck How you guys doing Wally dennison,cpd Where's agent morgan Detective gordinski's in with the suspect now I need to see him When my partner's finished talking to him I have your superintendent's personal cell number, and in the interest of not running roughshod over another police agency I've resisted calling him so far I need to see agent morgan now I'll get gordinski He's the,uh,primary I don't like them calling him a suspect Me neither You're the last person anyone saw with my victim You recognize him Found in an alley four years ago Still unidentified John doe Just like that kid whose grave you visit every time you come to chicago Another boy Just after you left the city This is crazy No kidding Look,man,rodney harris He's been following me around ever since I got back to town Rodney harris the gangbanger Yeah,he was waiting for me outside of a corner store He did that drive-by yesterday So you think this looks like something a gangbanger did Is that how you'd advise me,mr Fbi Dennison: Stan All right,tell him I'll be there in a minute You're gonna have to come up with something better than a gangbanger,derek Detective gordinski,cpb You think an fbi agent,a bau profiler committed a homicide Actually,three homicides at least,over 15 years You-you think he's a serial killer This is ridiculous Has he been charged with anything I got 72 hours for that I'd like to see him Be my guest This way Agent gideon,right Yes I owe you a big thank you I had no suspects at all until you looked over my case for me and sent me this profile Everything in it points to that son of a bitch,derek morgan I profiled him It's all right there Detective,a profile's just a guide Yeah,this one guided me to him They're really more useful in the elimination of suspects rather than the inclusion That's not the way you presented it to me Well,if I confused you,I'm sorry I'm not confused at all Look,whatever it is in here that made you consider agent morgan a suspect has to be coincidencE You can't rely solely on this You're right,I'm not You ok This kid I was with him yesterday So So he's dead I drove him home,hotch,and gordinski's saying I was the last person seen with him One of my first cases was a black kid strangled in a vacant lot near here Boy was a john doe,right Still unidentified to this day Wait,a 12-year-old kid that no one reported missing Ever Four years ago,another body turns up,same M O Worked that case just as hard,came up with just as much nothing Nobody in the area had ever seen the kid before No one's looking for these kids Then a few months back,I attended a seminar that you taught at cpd headquarters I told you about my case,you said to send you the files and you'd look 'em over This is the profile you worked up There are about 3 million people in chicago Your profile said I was looking for a black male,25 to 35,with a knowledge of the area Nonthreatening to children- either knows them or is normal enough that he doesn't scare them A probable criminal record It also said the way the body was placed gently on a mattress,not just tossed on the ground, indicated someone who was probably consumed with guilt,especially for the first victim Your exact words are- "with a guilt-ridden offender,"the bau postulates the first victim is the most important " and the unsub may still visit the place of the crime or even the victim himself " Care to guess who visits my first victim every time he's in town Can't be just visiting the victim There has to be more than that Sure You said the unsub might try to inject himself into the investigation to keep tabs on it Morgan has called our headquarters many times since he joined the bureau Always about this case So,wait,he talked to you about it Headquarters He'd never call me After I got your profile,I checked airline records Turns out derek had just left chicago when the other body turned up Tell me the story from the beginning I- I guess it starts when I was 15 I was coming home from football practice one day Me and my boy,we were goofing off, you know,we were throwing a football around The only person that I'd ever seen dead before that was my father when I was ten I mean,there I was,I was looking at this kid and he was my own age,hotch Dead in this vacant lot And he was never identified Nobody knew who he was,nobody ever even reported him missing And that,that just didn't sit right with me So I-I felt responsible for him,I mean,I was the one that found him,right I went around the neighborhood,door to door,trying to start a collection, and eventually I got enough so I could bury him,and I gave him a little headstone What did you put on the headstone if he wasn't identified Morgan: Just the date I left room for a name if he was ever identified And you still visit him Hotch,I go see this kid every time I'm home I just feel like he deserves to have somebody look in on him Gordinski must read that as a guilty conscience,a killer revisiting his victim But that can't be the only reason he suspects you Believe me,that guy's had it in for me my entire life He's supremely confident that you're his killer Then yesterday another kid ends up dead and the last person he was with was derek morgan In the boy's pocket we found one of his fbi business cards, his cell number written on the back of it In fact,every time morgan's in town,he hangs out with kids This is all just coincidence A hell of a lot of coincidences It's purely circumstantial So's a fingerprint Did I mention that morgan found the body in 1991 Hidden way back in a vacant lot Now,don't you teach that when a body is hard to find, the person finding it is always a suspect Reid: There are key pieces of the profile that don't fit,detective Uh,the age,25 to 35,morgan was 15 or so at the time Also says that age is the hardest to predict, and I should never exclude someone simply because of a discrepancy with the age What about the speculation that since he didn't managed to leave any evidence at the scene of the crime and he most likely has a criminal record or previous law enforcement knowledge Derek wasn't even in the bureau yet when the first body was found He may not have had a knowledge of law enforcement but derek morgan definitely had a criminal record A desperate detective here Three dead boys,no evidence at all, so he applies the profile directly to someone he already suspected It's easy to get tunnel vision that way One begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts That's,uh,one of sherlock holmes's favorite quotes We need to figure out who really killed these boys before they decide to charge morgan What do you want us to do Last victim was someone morgan was seen with Conveniently,morgan was already a suspect in the other two Someone set him up We should consider morgan a victim Prentiss,you and reid talk to his family,learn about him- especially around the time of the first murder Do we have the address I can take you Oh,that's ok Gideon: No Actually,that's not a bad idea Right Okey-doke,lead the way,detective According to morgan,he's got a bad history with gordinski He's got a bad history generally Resisting arrest,vandalism,aggravated battery This is morgan As a juvenile Look at the dates This isn't in his personnel file He said he told me everything relevant Then he either lied or he doesn't consider this relevant Since when is the criminal history of a suspect not relevant You just called him a suspect Get garcia into morgan's life Yes,sir Hey,hotch,I almost forgot There's a local banger out here,his name is rodney harris He's been running these streets for a while now You have a criminal record What Where did you get this What difference does that make Hotch this was supposed to be expunged My record's clean I asked you if there was anything you hadn't told me A judge expunged this,it doesn't exist anymore,man I was a kid,it's nothing Aggravated battery I- Ok I was with some guys,we got in a fight with some other guys Rodney,this cat I'm trying to tell you about,it was him We got into it a little bit,we knocked each other around, he got a couple stitches in his head so they made it aggravated That's it So you're saying this rodney committed three murders because you beat him up No I'm saying he's been following me around since I got here, so go talk to him and you might get something This was expunged You still should've told me You know how important accurate information is to victimology Whoa Victimology It's very likely the latest victim was an attempt to set you up Are you profiling me Morgan,we need to look at- no We don't need to do anything Derek,you're in trouble here Hotch,I didn't do this I am not worried about gordinski out there You still have three dead children Ok,ok,so you profile them That's the case Is there something else you don't want us to find out about Hotch,I don't need the people I work with going into my entire world Is,uh,derek all right He wouldn't let us go down there He's fine Our boss is with him Did he tell you gordinski's been harassing him since he was a kid Reid: Why's that You'd have to ask that bastard Oh,sarah It's true,mom Sure it is What are you even doing in my mother's house They asked me Oh,really I don't understand how they could think he did this Someone may be trying to make it look like he hurt those kids And the police believe it Just following the evidence But he's an fbi agent Reid: Actually law enforcement officials are just as probable statistically to commit a crime as anyone else Look at the cross-section of a society,there's a general population and a small fraction- he's not actually saying we believe derek's involved in this Oh,no,no,yeah,not at all I'm merely,um- speaking theoretically You're dr Reid,right Mm-hm Derek talks about you He does Anyway,so someone may be trying to make it look like this was derek But derek loves kids Every time he's here,he goes to the youth center Youth center The upward youth center Does that have some sort of significance for him Oh are you saying there's something in it for him Other than giving back to the poor kids of your neighborhood Sarah sarah,we're friends of your brother'S We're here trying to help When we ask a question,it isn't to denigrate or demean anything he's done We just have to know everything,so we can figure out where to look next Is there some special significance to the youth center The youth center saved his life Does this make any sense to you No He's clearly hiding something else Well,we know he isn't involved in any murders No There are larger implications We can't have people on this team who have secrets Oh,come on,hotch,we all have secrets Would you want us profiling you I feel terrible looking into his life like this I know,just remember we're trying to help him Garcia: Right,ok Graduated with honors from northwestern law Did you know he was a star football player Surprisingly,I don't know much about him at all Quarterback That's the guy who throws the ball,right Yes Ha That's what he was Full ride athletic scholarship Sophomore year he severely injured his left knee and he never played again Ok,garcia,look further back,ok Before college Garcia: Right Where are we Ok,um wait He was mentioned in the chicago register as body of a ch-child in a vacant lot in 1991 That's our first victim Garcia: He never told me about this He never told any of us My husband,um,their father,was killed when he tried to stop a robbery Derek was with him,he was ten A year or so later,he started getting into trouble What kind of trouble He started running around with older kids They would give him money to run errands for them Not drugs No,derek would never disgrace his father's name But they were gangbangers So people started looking at derek like he was one of them One night,he and a friend were attacked by some boys from another gang Big fight And one of the other boy's head split open And that was the first time gordinski arrested him Now,he wasn't a detective yet,just a street cop, but from that night on,no matter what happened in the neighborhood,he'd pick derek up for it Dennison: Probably because he was involved The hell he was Stan's never arrested anyone who didn't need arresting He did with derek Until carl buford stepped in Carl buford He runs a youth center He took derek under his wing Mentored him Became like a surrogate father He taught him football and that changed derek's life He got a scholarship to college,with it he got his degree Where is carl buford now He still runs the youth center I'd like to talk to him Detective,do you think you could take me over there Just you Yeah I thought maybe you could stay here and keep going through this stuff Good idea Yeah,keep going through the stuff Is there a criminal history Garcia: Criminal Garcia,is there a criminal history Jj,there's not gonna be a- There's a sealed file Unseal it But it's a sealed file Garcia,helping him Ah Right Helping him,helping him that's a juvenile criminal record It was expunged and sealed by a judge esposito after presentation of a letter and testimonial from a local youth center director "Finest young man I've ever known, "criminal record could jeopardize "potential scholarship offers stake my personal and professional reputation " garcia: He was definitely a fan of our boy Do we have a name Hang on a second I'm carl buford I've brought damien walters' mother to see detective gordinski Hi,carl Stan Mrs Walters,thanks for coming This way Buford Did you just say buford would you just give me the hell out here That wouldn't be a good idea,would it Says who Apparently I provided the profile that led them to arrest you You what They sent the case to me a few months ago I did a routine consult but he was looking for it to lead to you Preconception of guilt We just can't force 'em to let you go,it's not gonna look too good with the local press Oh,like I give a damn about the press,gideon Well,we cannot appear to be covering something up You trying to say something to me right now Only if you're hiding something You need to trust us Trust us enough to tell us about it Gideon It's not about trust It's about having a little privacy I got the right to keep something to myself Look at us,man,we practically live together already Then the best way to clear you is find the real unsub Find anything out about morgan The record wasn't picked up in his background check because everything in it was expunged and the file sealed by a judge Forgiving judge It was based on the recommendation of an upstanding member of the community who took personal responsibility for morgan That sounds like somebody we should talk to for more background Should be easy,he's right over there Hello Mr Buford This guy's been honored by everybody but the nobel society That's carl buford Who are you I'm with the fbi Do you know derek morgan Yeah,he's a friend of mine I've been trying to call him He's a little busy right now Is there something I can do to help you I just a friend of mine Someone killed him yesterday Do you know something about who might have done it No Derek's always telling me if I need somebody to talk to,about anything,I can call him Guess I just wanted to I don't know I'll tell you what Why don't you give me your name and I'll let him know that you've been trying to reach him James barfield Does he know where to find you He can find me here Anytime All the time You folks work with derek morgan Yes,sir,closely You knew him well as a teenager One of the finest boys I ever coached Football I run a youth center I gather you were instrumental in helping to get his criminal records expunged I feel terrible about that now You do Well,in view of what's happened What's happened is a mistake I'm confused,I thought stan said there was all kinds of evidence There is Thanks,carl,you can take miss walters home now Appreciate you bringing her in Of course,of course Derek morgan It's still hard for me to believe For them,too I can understand that Derek had a way of charming people into looking past his deficiencies Excuse me,deficiencies Well,you've seen the records Derek was at the youth center yesterday,wasn't he Playing football with damien walters and some other boys Carl's the one that saw 'em leaving together Did you talk to him I was working inside By the time I was done,they were leaving When was the last time you did talk to him I don't know Years If you need anything else,stan Anything at all Thanks,carl Appreciate it You seem friendly with mr Buford I can't tell you how many times that guy's come through for me Goin' way back to my beat cop days Carl buford knows the kids in this neighborhood better than almost anybody He's knocked more than a few of them back onto the straight and narrow Has he kept up with the investigation I'm sorry Over the years,does he ask how it's going Yeah,he'S wait a second,you're not gonna try to turn this off on him to save your guy,are you Just a question Carl buford is a local hero I'm sure he is Carl buford What Carl buford,he runs the youth center What's that got to do with anything He's responsible for getting your records expunged I told you to stay the hell out of my business You said you visit the youth center every time you come here So what Buford says he hasn't spoken to you in years Why don't you visit the man who made your career possible Damn you,hotch It is none of your damn business Buford's the one who told detectives you were with damien I am warning you,hotch Back off I'm not saying it's mr Buford There's a huge amount of investigation left to be done For 15 years he hasn't been the slightest bit suspicious Morgan won't even talk about buford He won't Buford should be that kid's hero Something happened You talking about carl buford Yes We just left his office Dennison: Hey What,did we turn him loose You let him escape Black male,33,six foot one,name is derek morgan You're standing there trying to convince me that a local hero is my killer while you let my suspect dance our the back door I'm gonna charge all of your asses Yes,as soon as possible You have to tell your officers that morgan's not a threat Like hell I will But this- lady,as far as I'm concerned,he is a threat,ok They're beyond reason We have to find hm first Any ideas His mother said that buford practically raised him after his father died, he mentored him,took him on trips,spent all of his time with him Basically became a surrogate father Jason,I think I know what he was afraid we'd find Detective,we may know where he's heading Lookin' good there,kid I was tryin' to call you I'm here now Someone killed damien I know James,we need to talk about carl buford What about him You're a star player,right Center of attention Yeah,I guess You know,I used to be that guy Yeah,I know It's a lot of pressure,isn't it Always wanna make 'em happy Impress 'em I can handle it Oh,I'm sure you can,kid Does he ever take you to his cabin What Fishin' in wisconsin,camping Do things you wish you had a real father for Sometimes Yeah,he's good like that You know about the cabin James,i told you,I used to be you What do you mean The first time you weren't even sure what was goin' on He brushed up against you You thought it might have just been an accident But then at the cabin,he let you sit and drink with him You thought it was kinda cool Made you feel grown He gave you a glass of wine Maybe a little shot of something harder And then he took you swimming Only he told you to jump in without your swimsuit on He did things to you,james,didn't he He did 'em to me,too You do whatever you think you gotta do to keep him happy because he's the closest thing to a father you got But what he's doin' to you is wrong And you don't have to let it continue,man - Yeah,I do My oldest brother's in jail,my sister was paralyzed in a drive-by,she's eight years old I'm all my mom's got left I gotta get us outta here Carl's gonna make sure I get into college Then I can make something of myself James,you are something,man You're something right here,right now,without carl buford You just gotta believe that Where's carl right now,huh Look at you,man You're out here in the dark running pass routes That's you That ain't got nothin' to do with carl What you got inside of here,that's what's gonna get you off these streets You never told Not until right now Damien always said I should call you What Damien knew I didn't think you'd believe me James I got your back Forever Carl You've been let go Looks that way I told 'em it was crazy,thinkin' you were involved in any killing Really Gordinski said you're the one who told 'em I drove damien home Was that supposed to be a secret No That wasn'T I don't follow All these years,I kept my mouth shut I let you go on being a hero Carl buford,my mentor What are you talkin' about God,I was so afraid of you I was afraid of the police,afraid of losing everything I was gaining But that's how you work,isn't it You make sure there's a hell of a lot to lose,don't you I don't know what you think you remember No,no,no See,it's not what I remember that's gonna hurt you,carl Our business is over way too long ago to matter You're protected by a statute of limitations and that's my fault Then good night You set me up You knew damien walters wanted james to call me about you So you killed him You killed him because you knew I'd come after you,didn't you Now you're just talking crazy God,I should have told somebody about you when I was a kid When you were helping me Well,you know what happens in cases like this Once that dam breaks,the flood comes One kid steps up,just one And then another one,and another Because they're not scared of you anymore They know they're not alone James barfield is your dam Whatever lies james told you they're not lies You did the same thing to me I did nothing to you,to james One by one,they're gonna pile up until there's so many accusations - You can't say that they're all lies any idea how many kids I've helped get out of this neighborhood Hm How many lives I've provided Look at you.
You'd probaby be dead by now.
yeah,well,it wasn't for free,was it I pulled you out of the gutter I pulled myself out of the gutter,all the way to the fbi I did that You sayin' I had nothin' to do with making you who you are No,carl Actually I'm saying you have everything to do with making me who I am Because of you I'm somebody who gets to spend the rest of this life making sure guys like you go down Look,derek carl: I never hurt you You could have said no You're under arrest,carl I've helped a lot of kids Let's go The neighborhood won't be the same without me It's gonna be worse without the center Somebody'll keep this center running The neighborhood will I will Wait Wait DereK isn't there something you can do for me You go to hell
