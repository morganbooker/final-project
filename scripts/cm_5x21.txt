Ugh! Good job today, Brenda.
Thanks, Keith.
This was a great haul.
Yeah.
They were really biting today.
It's been a while.
Why don't you head back to town.
I want to put the rest in the smoker.
I'll drop you off.
No.
I could do with the walk.
Get home to your wife.
You sure? Lisa wouldn't mind if I waited for you.
I'll be fine.
Go home.
All right, well, don't stay too late, all right? Ok.
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.
See you.
Is anyone there? "is anyone there," Brenda? Right.
'cause the homicidal maniac hiding in the shadows Is really going to answer you.
Keith? Stop messing around.
It's not funny.
Oh! Oh, it's you.
I thought someone was-- Ohh! JJ, that's not the point.
Well, are you gonna call him? Maybe.
Emily.
Mick Rawson is an arrogant, Oversexed, egotistical-- Hot British dude with a sexy accent, badge, and gun.
Just your type.
Ugh.
You know what? I don't even get you sometimes.
Sorry.
It wouldn't go anywhere.
You don't know that.
I know our work schedules.
Ok, you know what? Will and I make it work.
Oh.
Oh, no.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Don't say it.
But when you see what's in here And it's not my fault.
They were calling to me, I swear.
And they were all on sale.
And when you think about it, that means that I am helping the economy, Which is more than I can say for you guys, 'cause no one else has bags.
Yeah.
Please tell me all of those aren't for my son.
They're not.
Good.
This one is for Kevin.
What? It is my duty as a fairy godmother To spoil the child.
And Henry is finally old enough To be fun when opening presents.
I'm not taking them back.
Give me my coffee and no one's gonna get hurt.
Oh, uh, half-caf extra shot venti, 2-pump nonfat, Hold the whip caramel macchiato.
Mm-hmm.
Next stop, Xanadu.
oh, wait.
UhXana-don't.
Time to go to the ball, ladies.
Maybe I should get a cat.
Whoa! Sorry to ruin your night.
What, are you working on wife number 4? I see you people way too much.
Let's get started.
All right.
Anchorage field office is asking us To investigate a series of murders in Franklin, Alaska.
There's 3 people dead in less than a week.
For a town with a population of 1,476, That's fairly significant.
It's their first murder investigation on record.
Who are the victims? Uh, Jon Baker, a hunter.
Dedaimia Swanson, a schoolteacher.
Brenda bright, the first mate on a fishing boat.
There's a new victim every 2 days.
Any connections? Unfortunately, in a town this small, Everyone's connected.
Different kill methods.
It says the first two victims Were both shot with a rifle, But Brenda bright was stabbed twice with an arrow? Are we sure it's the same guy? All 3 victims were found in heavily trafficked areas.
The unsub wants them found sooner than later.
Jon Baker's body was left exposed to the elements, But the two women were buried under mounds of trash.
Why? It could be a sign of remorse.
Cover their bodies so he doesn't have to face The reality of what he's done.
Or he thinks that the women are trash And he's just placed them where he thinks they belong.
Well, we can't be sure of anything yet.
Franklin is an isolated fishing community That's been hit really hard by the current economy.
Add to that a series of unsolved murders and everyone's on edge.
The local sheriff's out of his depth.
And Alaska hasn't handled a serial investigation Since Robert Hansen in the eighties.
We'll fly out tonight.
Everybody can sleep on the plane.
Garcia, I need you with us.
Sir? I've tasked a satellite uplink And it's your job to keep us connected.
Yes, sir.
This town's already on the brink, And if this pattern continues, we've only got another day Until the next murder.
Let's finish this fast.
"nature in her most dazzling aspects "or stupendous parts, "is but the background and theater Of the tragedy of man.
" John Morley.
This guy's all over the map.
Crosses sex and race boundaries.
He changed his kill method.
It says to me he's disorganized.
Yet there weren't prints at any of the crime scenes, And he isolated his victims.
Wearing gloves and making sure There aren't any witnesses-- that's a no-brainer.
But what concerns me is the evolution of the kills.
Evolution? Well, he started with easy prey.
Jon Baker was in his mid sixties.
It's relatively low-risk for a first-timer.
Dedaimia Swanson was in her early fifties.
She wouldn't be that difficult to overpower.
But he didn't have to overpower either one of them.
Both victims were shot.
Which is my point exactly.
He killed them both from a safe distance.
But Brenda bright was younger, more athletic.
She would have been able to put up much more of a fight, So why not shoot her, too? That supports the disorganized theory.
Maybe he didn't get what he wanted from his first two victims.
Brenda bright was an attractive woman.
He used an arrow, but he didn't shoot her with it.
He stabbed her.
I think we all know what that means.
When we land in Anchorage, There'll be a float plane to take us to Franklin.
When we get there, Morgan and Prentiss work the crime scene.
We need to know exactly how he ambushed his victims.
Reid and Rossi, the bodies.
Find out what you can there.
JJ and I will work victimology.
And, Garcia, town records.
Find us something we can use.
Of course, sir.
I should let everybody know That reception in the area is unreliable at best.
I'm giving everybody satellite phones for communication, And I've already preprogrammed all your digits into speed dial.
Guess who's lucky number 7.
Welcome to Franklin.
I'm deputy flack.
Are these the docks that Brenda bright was working The night she was killed? Yes.
All right, we'll get started here.
Agent Hotchner? Yes, sir.
Sheriff Rhodes.
Very nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, sir, ma'am.
Hi.
So I cannot tell you how grateful I am That you all could come.
The people here are really starting to act up.
I'm afraid our little town's a bit of a powder keg.
Where would you like us to set up, sir? You see, there's not much room at the station Because that's also the post office.
But I have made arrangements for you to work Out of Carol's tavern, which is right over there.
Thank you.
Well, thank you.
Appreciate it.
It's pretty isolated out here.
How do you get basic supplies? Float planes bring grocery and hardware deliveries On a weekly basis, and fishermen and hunters provide The town's meat supply.
Hey.
I'm Craig Ramey.
You all the FBI? What gave us away? You're sure packing an awful lot of stuff for a fishing trip.
I'm not going fishing.
Getting the hell out of dodge Before it's me or my wife put in the ground.
Did you know Brenda well? Everyone did.
She was sweet.
She's pull a haul just as good as any guy on these docks.
As soon as I get my house boarded up, I'm heading out.
Suggest you do the same, Susan.
I can't say that I blame him.
With what's been going on, I'm surprised more people aren't trying to leave.
This is Keith graves.
He was with Brenda the night she died.
Mr.
Graves, Did you notice anything out of the ordinary the night of the murder? No.
I offered to wait for her, But she insisted I head up to town without her.
What were you two doing that night? We finished for the day.
I left.
She stuck around to clean the fish That she wanted to take home.
She usually walk home alone? Yeah.
Brenda said that walking Was good for the soul.
How far is it into town? About a half a mile.
The unsub could have waited for her anywhere.
Appreciate your time.
Sheriff asked me to keep everyone on ice Till you got here.
Still, I can't believe someone from Franklin Would be capable of this.
What convinced you she was stabbed with the arrow Instead of shot? Upward angle at the point of entry.
He would have had to been shooting from beneath her.
There wasn't much left.
Forest got to him first.
I found urine on the remains.
Urine? I thought it was from the animals Who scavenged his body, but I got the lab results back this morning.
The urine was human.
Is he marking his victims? Only found it on Jon.
Both the women were clean.
Jon was shot 3 times.
The unsub grazed him twice and then hit him in the head.
Dedaimia Swanson was only shot once.
The first kill shows hesitation, uncertainty.
He wasn't confident taking the terminal shot.
It was either accidental or spur of the moment, But the second kill, he only needed one shot.
He's progressing quickly.
Were you close with the victims? An occupational hazard when you're the only doctor in town.
I delivered Brenda.
Never thought I'd outlive her.
Look at the cuts on her torso.
They're shallow and non-penetrating.
Not necessary for the murder.
You know what? These were made postmortem.
He's playing with the bodies, Experimenting with his methodology.
Someone incapable of remorse.
We're dealing with a psychopath.
Have you determined whether or not she was raped? I didn't even think to look.
Your report says the assault occurred here.
That's right.
There was a trail of blood Coming from that direction.
I don't see any blood.
We covered it up.
You contaminated the scene? We had to.
We've got a rabid bear in the woods.
It's been ripping smaller game to shreds.
A creature like that smells blood, He'll come into town, no hesitation.
Ok, you said the other two victims were found similar to this? Jon was found on the edge of the woods.
Dedaimia was up by crest falls.
It's a popular hiking route.
Who would know their routines? Everyone.
Cup of coffee, Jace? Whoa.
What are you doing? Trying to make this place a little less analog.
Sorry.
I forget my hacker jokes aren't funny.
My name is Penelope.
I'm the one who doesn't carry a weapon, Aside from my biting wit.
And my job includes combining my kick-ass systems With your sheriff's department database To get the skinny on your neighbors and you.
Or you could just ask us what you want to know.
I mean, isn't it better to just talk to us directly Than look up our dirt secretly? No.
Because in my experience, The information superhighway never lies and people do.
Your name would be? Josh.
My mom Carol, she owns the place.
It goes like this.
Here we are.
Joshua Beardsley, age 23, Born right here in Franklin, AK.
Moved to Anchorage for middle and High School.
Majored in hotel management at Seattle u.
And you moved back home a few weeks ago.
Perfect timing, huh? I come home, people start dying.
Hmm.
That's when I check your criminal record.
And you, my friend, are clean as a whistle.
What does that even mean? No idea.
No dirt, anyway, so, I guess I'm safe, then? For now.
Those two got into it last night.
Bob here, he's our newest resident, so, uh, Tom figures, well, this is the guy who's doing all the killings.
He decides to smash him over the head with a bottle of booze.
Look, I don't know what to do.
Have you thought about having a kind of town hall meeting Where you get everybody together and talk about the facts of the case? The town's too spread out.
I mean, everybody's doing what they can just to get by, you know? Sheriff, I know people move to these remote locations to be left alone, But what happened last night is gonna keep happening, And people are going to start taking matters into their own hands.
Well, I can keep order in my own town, But people around here, I mean, This is Alaska, man.
They do what they want.
He's already experimenting with his victims.
He violated Brenda bright with an arrow.
And he's inciting panic.
People who have lived here most of their lives Are packing up to leave.
Can you blame them? We have a psychopath Whose hunting ground is a town of 1,400 people.
Most of them grew up learning to kill animals and start fires.
It sounds like your basic survival skills.
No.
They're hunting skills.
Think about it.
The marksmanship, The urine-- it makes sense.
The urine makes sense? It's a hunter's trick.
You urinate downwind to keep the animals away.
He tried to preserve Jon Baker's body So it would be discovered intact.
All right, so we've got a psychopath with hunting skills Who knows the routines of everyone in town.
How are we supposed to keep everyone safe? Sheriff, I suggest you institute a curfew Until we have the unsub in custody.
Nobody out after dark.
I'll have one of my deputies Patrolling around the clock.
Garcia, how's it coming with town records? I've run everyone who's been printed through CODIS.
Nothing's come up so far.
I'm gonna pull an all-nighter, Finish going through the town records.
Should have background checks by sunrise.
Good.
The rest of us should get some sleep, Start fresh in the morning.
I've got 4 of the upstairs rooms available.
Uh, 4? Come on, that's the best we can do.
Your team is double the size of my department.
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.
It looks like we'll have to double up.
I'm not sleeping with Reid.
Dibs.
What do you mean, you're sharing a room with Morgan? Oh, you're jealous.
Jealous? Why? Because you're bedding down with a Muscle-bound, modern-day 007? Mm, he's more like Jason Bourne.
Oh, what's there to be jealous about? He took the floor.
Ok.
Just Just make sure He keeps his weapon holstered, OK? Why are you up right now, anyway? It's so late.
Actually, it's early.
I just got to Quantico.
Ohh.
Damn time zones.
hello? Hello? Hello.
OhhFrak.
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on, come on, come on.
Nice one, Garcie.
Oh! OhhOh Look at me.
Hey.
You're gonna be OK.
My name's Penelope.
You're gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK.
Just keep looking at me.
Help! Help! Please! Somebody come help here! Someone is hurt! Please! His name's Craig Ramey.
Fisherman.
Morgan and I met him this morning.
He was packing up to leave.
He's accelerating his schedule.
We should have had another day.
Why change that? Ramey was pretty vocal about wanting to get out of town.
If the unsub knew that, he could have struck early To prevent his target from getting away.
There has to be more to it than that.
He brought the body to the tavern we're staying at.
He's telling us that he's not afraid of us.
He's gaining confidence.
He switched to a hunting knife.
Looks like a jagged edge.
There's more physical damage, too, like he was cut open.
I won't know until Dr.
Johnson does an autopsy, But I'd be willing to bet he took a piece of the victim with him.
What kind of piece? It's hard to say, but judging from the location, I would guess liver or spleen.
He was alive.
What? He was still alive.
Baby, there's nothing else you could have done.
I felt him leave.
He was there one second, And then-- just a body.
I'm really sorry that you had to see all of that.
Derek, I--I didn't see, I was in it.
I was sort of used to seeing horrible things From the safety of my screens every day, But this was Right there.
Why didn't you go and find someone before you ran out there? Because when I got shot, I remember thinking The last thing I'm ever gonna see in this life Is the man who killed me, And I couldn't let that happen to him.
He had to see something good before he died.
You ran right towards the unsub.
You could have been killed.
I know that.
Don't treat me like I'm the victim.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I want to ask you a couple of questions, all right? No.
I--I told you everything I saw.
You said the man's face was mostly in shadow, But there was also a lot of blood on it.
You might have seen more than you actually realize.
No.
Cognitive interviews, breaking someone's death down to a science And statistic-- that is your world, Derek, Not mine! I will help from mine.
Penelope! Derek, let her go.
Will you look after her, please? Yeah, of course.
Was Garcia able to give you any new information? She's given all she can.
This guy's taunting us.
He's one step ahead.
I think you're giving him more credit than he deserves.
It's like Emily said on the plane, he's all over the place.
The victimology's inconsistent, The methodology's evolving, The first kill was sloppy, hesitant, and unplanned.
It was an accident, But it triggered a sexual response.
He got off on it.
And he knew then and there he had to kill again.
He learned how to get the job done more efficiently.
Yeah, but why the organs? Consumption typically indicates a desire To keep the victim with them.
He's having trouble letting go.
We're probably looking for someone with severe abandonment issues.
It'll be light soon.
Let's get everybody together And go over what we know.
We're looking for an emotionally immature male, Probably in his mid to late twenties, Who suffered a traumatic loss.
Now, this loss could be anything.
Death of a parent, separation of a spouse, a loved one who moved away.
Something that made the unsub feel abandoned and alone.
He'll have extensive hunting experience.
The bodies were buried not because of remorse, They were buried to protect them from wild animals.
His familiarity with the victims' routines Suggests the unsub has lived here for most of his life.
He also has extensive knowledge Of the landscape and surroundings.
So we should split up and cover the town.
Focus on younger residents with a history of petty crimes and assaults.
You should look in their trash, Fireplaces, even in laundry.
Look for signs of bloody clothes or even cuts and bruises.
One of the victims may have gotten in a good blow or two Before they died.
Bring in anyone who seems to have something to hide.
The unsub has already broken patterns, So he could strike again at any time.
Sheriff, you and I need to look at the school, Talk to the teacher, see if she remembers any students exhibiting Early signs of homicidal tendencies.
Let's move.
Dedaimia was only one month away from retirement.
I can't believe she's gone.
We're very sorry for your loss.
I need to ask about your former students.
Do you remember any of them enjoying hunting Too much, so much that it worried you? All the boys around here like it too much.
They have competitions to see who's the better shot.
This would have been extreme.
Do you remember anyone who might have tortured animals Or played with them before he killed them? Does that sound like someone you know? I've never seen anyone enjoy hunting as much as Joshua Beardsley.
He's the tavern owner's son? Yeah.
The youngest boy in town to bag a deer.
That's all he ever talked about.
He hunted something nearly every day.
He was born and raised here.
He returned a couple of weeks ago after his dad died.
How old is he? Sure.
We need to talk to him.
All right.
Thank you.
What's this about? The strike was above the gut.
It keeps the meat from spoiling.
Isn't that right? On a deer, maybe.
Doubt it'd be the same for a human.
But then he did something interesting.
He took the victim's spleen.
Now, tell me, Why would he do that? No idea.
Let's stop playing games, Joshua.
Answer my questions and maybe I'll believe you.
It's a native hunting tradition, isn't it? Eat part of the kill.
Gain the life force of your prey.
Not many people know that.
I'm not many people.
Where did you learn to hunt? Bagged my first deer when I was 7.
That's pretty young.
My dad taught me how to live off the land.
I ate the heart of my first kill.
That proves you're a true hunter.
So, you, um, enjoy hunting? It's my favorite thing to do.
Then would you say you take pleasure in the kill? Doesn't everyone? Actually, no They don't.
What do you think? I'm not sure.
He fits the profile, but he's acting like a man with nothing to hide.
The attack cycle's accelerating.
He should strike tonight.
And if he doesn't, we know we've got our guy in custody.
And what if he does? Look, I hate to say it, But half this town matches most of your profile.
Hey.
What are you guys working on? Hotch asked if we'd go through Garcia's background profiles, Try to find a link between Joshua and the 4 victims.
You find anything? They all had hunting licenses.
needle, meet haystack.
Yeah, we need the big guns.
Ripped and ready to rumble.
Uh, maybe you should sit this one out.
No, Jaje, I'm OK.
Put this bastard where he belongs.
Joshua Beardsley? Yeah.
We think he's our unsub.
No, he's not.
He fits the profile.
Abandonment issue triggered by his father's recent death.
Hunting experience, Reid-- Experimentation with animals.
Reid.
You arrested my son? We brought him in as a precaution.
I'm telling you, it's not him.
What makes you so sure? Because the unsub ran away from me.
Of course he ran.
He knew you were FBI.
But Joshua knows I'm a techie.
He knows I don't carry a weapon.
If he was the unsub, I'd be dead right now.
How can you be listening to any of this, Steve? You know Joshua would never do this.
Look, I never thought any of us were capable of doing this.
But 4 people are dead, Carol.
You don't know him.
He's a good boy.
He's a good boy who recently lost his father And it's a lot of emotional stress.
It's been tough, but we're coping.
He's doing fine.
Why did he move back to town? I needed him here to help with the inn.
I can't handle it on my own.
And how did that make him feel, Having to drop everything and move back home? He didn't do this.
We need to be sure.
I'm sure.
I'm his mother.
Carol, it's one night.
If nothing happens, you pick him up in the morning.
Wait a minute.
You said the unsub has abandonment issues.
And Craig Ramey was leaving town, right? Yeah, he couldn't wait to get out of town.
Ok.
UhLet's see.
Dedaimia Swanson was retiring in a month.
She was moving to Florida.
What about the other two? UN, Jon Baker just bought property in Fairbanks, And he and his wife just separated.
She just filed the divorce papers.
Well, welcome back, red delicious.
Take a bite out of this.
So far, 3 of our victims Were on the fast track to getting out of town.
And let's see Connect 4.
Brenda just accepted a job in Seattle.
Anyone else look like they might be leaving town? UmI got one.
Kat Allen.
She was accepted to the summer honors program At the university of Bloomington.
She currently works as a waitress at big John's coffeehouse.
Penelope, you are-- So ready to go home.
Prentiss.
Hi.
We're looking for Kat Allen.
I'm Kat.
Can we talk? It was completely unexpected.
Never been married.
I'd given up on ever having kids.
Do you mind my asking who the father is? A guy I met on a cruise.
He doesn't want anything to do with her.
But I do.
I want to be able to give her a good life, So I'm going back to school.
Did you tell anyone that you were leaving? Yeah.
A couple of people.
Uh, I don't know My mom.
My boss.
We're going to need you to come with us.
Why? What's this about? It's just for tonight.
It's for your protection.
Damn it.
Aah! Aah! Uhh! Uhh! The neighbors saw the door open, called it in.
He went from ambushing people in public to home invasion.
That's a pretty big change in m.
O.
This one's personal.
It's angry.
Her intestines are splayed out everywhere.
Yeah.
And the blood on her face is smeared, not splattered.
He played with the body.
He mutilated her.
If this guy's killing people leaving town, Why didn't he attack Kat Allen? Because we had her in protective custody.
He couldn't get to her, so he moved on to another target.
A target who broke her routine.
Carol was scheduled to be at the tavern tonight.
How did the unsub know she was here? He was stalking her.
He chose Carol for a different reason.
Why? What's changed? You guys finally realize I'm innocent? Joshua, please have a seat.
More questions? You serious? I'm telling you, I didn't do this.
We know that, son.
Please, sit down.
What's going on? Josh, the--the killer struck again last night.
Ohh, God.
Who did he get? Why are you guys only telling me this? Where's my mom? No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, that's impossible.
She--she was just here.
I--I just talked to her! I'm sorry, Joshua.
She's gone.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
You-- You're lying.
I wish we were.
I need to see her.
Not right now.
You don't want to think of her that way.
Joshua, we know you need time to mourn, But the fact of the matter is, the man who did this Is still out there, and we think that you can help us find him.
You had me locked up While she was-- I could have helped her.
If you had gone to her, There's a good chance you'd both be dead.
Now we need your help.
Why me? The murders began when you returned to town.
Now, up until now, he's only targeted people Who were trying to leave, but for some reason, With your mother, it was personal.
The pressure's on.
The FBI is here.
In that situation, a serial killer wants to finish what he started, He goes after the true target of his cause.
Personal? Can you think of anyone who had a grudge against her? Anyone at all? How about anyone with a grudge against you? No.
No.
Everybody loved her.
The man that we're looking for has severe abandonment issues.
Now, can you think of a time When you or your mother left somebody, Maybe like a bad break-up or a fight that ended a friendship? Did your mother ever take anyone in at the inn Who had family problems, Maybe someone who had been kicked out Or lost someone unexpectedly? No.
No, no, no, no, there was nothing like that.
Uh, listen, can I go see my mom now? Josh.
Josh, you need to let these people help.
No, I need-- I need to see my mom.
Well, let's have someone take you.
It's OK.
I know the way.
Did you see his behavior shift From wanting to help us to wanting to leave? He's lying.
Because he knows who the unsub is.
I got one of my deputies tailing Joshua.
If he does something stupid, we're gonna know.
There's got to be a connection we're missing.
Garcia, anything? Their lives have been torn apart, Figuratively and literally, and I can't find anything.
Try again.
I'm hacking into his college database as we speak.
Maybe there's something about his life in Seattle I may have missed.
Good.
All right, why Carol? Why the mutilation? Why the overkill? Mutilation? You said you found the remains Of mutilated animals in the woods from a rabid bear? That's right.
Did you take pictures of them? Of course we did.
We documented everything for identification.
We'll need to see those pictures right away.
Sheriff, we need to adjust the profile.
What do you mean? These animals weren't mutilated by a rabid bear.
Someone did this.
You mean a person.
An animal wouldn't have left so much.
We should have seen it before.
It's homicidal triad 101.
We said the kills were all over the map.
The unsub lacks sophistication and shows immaturity In his kills because he is immature.
He started with animals because that's what he was taught Ever since he was a child.
And when he got bored with animals, He moved on to more challenging prey.
People.
Your unsub's a teenage boy.
The boy we were talking about before, He wouldn't be a former student, he'd be a current student, A teenager who loves to hunt.
I only have two teenagers right now.
Both of them are girls.
Go ahead, Garcia.
I found something uber weird.
In Joshua's college application essay, He talks about the impact that being an older brother had on his life.
I thought he didn't have any siblings.
He doesn't, and yet he's talking About how hard it was to leave him behind When he moved to Anchorage, To leave him unprotected.
Thanks.
Was there a student that Joshua may have taken under his wing Before he moved away? Someone you may have suspected was being abused? Oh, my God.
What? Owen Porter.
He's not a student anymore.
He's home-schooled.
Joshua and he were attached at the hip when they were younger.
I've been called out to the Porter house several times.
Domestic disturbance.
Owen and his mom always covering for the dad.
Let's go.
Thanks.
Talk about abandonment issues.
Owen was left victim to the abusive hand of his father.
Joshua's return probably derailed Owen's mental stability.
Add to that the accidental shooting of Jon Baker and he snapped.
He got off on that first killing.
He had to do it again.
So he targeted people trying to leave town.
In his mind, when people leave, he gets hurt.
And he resented Carol for taking Joshua away, So he killed her to make sure he never left again.
Where would he go now? We're surrounded by waterways and mountains.
He could be anywhere.
Mr.
Porter, is your son at home? What's it to you? Turn that off.
Did you know? Don't know what you're talking about! Not for sure.
Not until last night.
He came home covered in blood.
He's not here.
But the window's open.
It's not the first time you've washed blood out of his clothes, is it? Don't answer them, Martha! Sit down and shut up.
I promise he will not lay a hand on you again.
No.
It wasn't the first time.
Mrs.
Porter, I understand you're only trying to protect Owen, But you can't anymore.
He's always been different.
He's not like us.
When he was a little boy, he used to go out into the woods And come home covered in blood.
Why didn't you tell anyone, Martha? How could you just sit there and do nothing while people died? How did Owen react when Joshua was sent away? He wanted to leave, too.
But I couldn't let him.
Mrs.
Porter, do you have any idea what social isolation Does to a child? I was afraid of what he might do If he ever left here.
We knew.
We knew what he was.
We've got a problem.
What is it? Joshua managed to shake deputy stiller.
And someone reported a hunting party going into the woods.
Oh, God.
They're hunting Owen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shh.
Listen.
That way.
Go.
You have him? No.
He's moving too fast.
Looks like he's circling back towards town.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Did they just shoot him? They would be shooting if they weren't close.
Let's go.
Do you know where he's headed? Was there a place he went to be alone? A hiding spot when you were mad at him? Hiding spot.
How the hell are we supposed to know? If you know, you need to tell me.
I'm trying to help him.
There's a mob out there, And if they find him, they're not gonna turn him over.
They're gonna take justice into their own hands.
If you value your son's life, you need to help me.
Martha, don't! Lake Lafayette.
He and Joshua built a fort there when they were younger.
You'll need a boat upriver to get there.
Hold on, guys.
Yeah, hotch, what's up? Ok.
I got it.
There's a new plan.
He's heading for the harbor.
Owen, put the gun down.
Drop it, son.
Who do you want to take your chances with, us or them? Drop the weapons and back away! Can't do that, agents.
The boy's coming with us.
It's not happening! Back down, Keith.
We're in control now.
What are you gonna do, Steve? He's 16.
Send him back to juvey so he's out in 2 years? He killed my mom.
He killed Brenda.
He needs help and he will be held accountable For his crimes.
Accountable? Why'd you do it, Owen? Huh? Why'd you kill her? You left me behind.
You killed my mom! She sent you away! You left and you didn't come back.
heard from you again.
Please, just let us take him in.
Sorry.
I can't.
I know what you're saying is right, But I can't do it.
I'm terribly sorry for your loss, But please just put your guns down so no one else gets hurt.
Are you kidding? You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Who do you think has the higher ground here? I'm pretty sure we do! I don't know.
What are you-- what are you doing? We can still take him! It's over, Joshua.
He killed my mom.
I know, And I'm sorry.
You shot him? Uhh! He'll live.
# I made a lover's pledge # # I made a lover's pledge # # then watched the sky # # and wanted to cry and # # and you and I # It sucks, doesn't it? What? Just knowing that we couldn't have done any of this without you.
Yeah, pretty much.
I'm proud of you, Penelope.
Despite everything that happened, you came back And you got the job done.
The sight of blood used to make me run away.
And two nights ago I ran towards it.
It means you're changing into someone stronger than you realize.
You cared enough to risk your own life To try and save someone else.
Yeah, but What's the difference between being strong And being jaded? I'm scared, Derek.
I don't want to lose who I am Just so I can do this job.
We are in one of the most beautiful places on earth.
I know you see that, don't you? Yeah.
Then we have nothing to worry about.
It's who you are, baby girl.
You see the beauty in everything and everyone No matter where you go.
That part of you is never gonna change, and I won't let it.
I don't need you to protect me.
Tough.
I think I'm gonna stay on the job a little while longer.
Yeah? Mm-hmm.
How much longer? Every day of my life.
I kind of love you, Derek Morgan.
I kinda love you, Penelope Garcia.
