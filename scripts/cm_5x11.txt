[grunting.]
Aah! You son of a bitch! Uhh! Did he bite you? Yeah.
All right, don't move.
Dale schrader, you're under arrest For the murder of stacy ryan And the kidnapping of your daughter jenny.
Man: Listen, we got him.
No, I'm afraid.
Please let me see my mom.
Where is she? No, your mom-- Your mom, she's gonna meet us at the hospital.
And he cannot hurt you.
You're gonna be fine.
Let me say good-bye to her.
You lost that right the minute you took her.
She's gonna be-- she's my daughter.
Jenny.
No, no, it's ok.
It's ok.
He can't hurt you.
Jenny.
I'm sorry.
You gonna ride in with her? Ok.
Yeah, I got it.
Jenny, listen to me.
I promise you He's gonna go away for a long time.
It's gonna be all right.
Prentiss: Ok.
Schrader: Jenny.
Prentiss: Hey.
Morgan's gonna wait for the ambulance.
Bunting and I are taking him in.
Yeah--no, the cabin's empty.
He just left Bunting: Yeah, cancel the amber alert.
Man, on radio: Roger that.
Truck recovered? Negative on the truck.
The girl's upset, but she seems ok.
Agent morgan is gonna bring her in.
He's gonna escort her in the ambulance.
They should be leaving in a couple minutes.
Yeah, we got her.
You want to talk to your mom? Mom? No, I'm ok.
I promise.
[police radio chatter.]
Killed a random woman and kidnapped his kid.
Used the same truck.
Not the brightest bulb.
He's been locked up for 11 years.
He's out of practice.
Don't they say these guys come out better criminals? Smart ones do.
You saying I'm dumb? You're impatient, angry.
You took your own kid just to get back at your ex.
You got it all figured out.
Well, your ex-wife said-- she was a liar.
And I should have killed her.
Like you killed stacy ryan? Why did you do it? You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
Here's what I don't get about this guy.
What's that? His whole life he's a thief, He comes out of prison a murderer.
He killed an innocent woman.
How do you know she's innocent? You stabbed her and threw her out of a truck.
What the hell did she ever do to you? You know, what I don't get Is why you couldn't just appreciate the freedom.
You could have holed up in that cabin a long time, Enjoyed the quiet.
But some people just need the distractions.
You probably got used to all that madness when you were locked up.
It's madness for the sheep to talk peace with a wolf.
That sounds like something my daddy would say.
Thomas fuller.
You impressed? I'm surprised.
So you're the wolf.
You have no idea.
There it is.
That ego.
You know, for one second, You were unpredictable.
But you can't help yourself.
You gotta talk a big talk.
But just so you know, that's boring.
[grunting.]
Hey, what was that? Sit up.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
What's going on? I don't know.
I'm gonna pull over.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Can you turn the light on? I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, what the hell? Ohh! Am I still boring? What? Am I boring?! [glass breaking, crash.]
[gasping.]
Ahh [groaning.]
Where are the keys? Uhh! [grunting.]
Oh, wait! I'm a federal agent! I have a prisoner in here who's just killed this officer! I knew it.
You are one committed son of a bitch.
Ohh! Oh, my arm! No, no, that's the prisoner! What are you doing? Uhh! Give me the gun.
What? What's wrong with you? You killed a cop? Give me the gun.
She's a fed.
Look, she knows there's two of us now.
You're gonna need stitches.
I'm not going to the hospital.
There's a lot of blood.
Put pressure on it.
You're gonna be all right.
Give me the gun.
Come on, give me the damn gun! Get in the truck! Come on! Come on! Uhh! Prentiss: "men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, Because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure.
" Tacitus.
Morgan: Pull over.
That's one of us.
Pull over.
Prentiss! Ohh.
What the hell happened? Are you all right? Bunting's down there.
He's dead.
Where's schrader? He's gone.
It was a--a big Truck, new york tags, Uh, victor alpha 737.
They went northbound about 10 minutes ago.
Son of a bitch got away.
He's got a partner.
First case back, we won, And you'll be home for breakfast.
We never figured out why schrader killed stacy ryan.
She had no connection to his daughter or his ex-wife.
There's been an accident.
Emily's in the hospital, bunting's dead.
Reid: Is she all right? She has a concussion.
Is morgan with her? Yeah.
Rossi: Where's schrader? Jj: Northbound in a truck.
A truck? He has a partner.
What? We need roadblocks--now.
Do we have a tag? Uh, emily murmured a partial.
Better than nothing.
He could be headed to canada.
We need somebody who knows the area.
I'll get an officer.
And jj-- Yeah, you want schrader's face everywhere.
Schrader was a bank robber.
Now he's murdered a woman, Kidnapped his daughter, and killed a cop.
He's obviously more sophisticated Than we originally thought.
He's got a bigger plan.
It's not just about Getting his daughter and fleeing the country.
We never profiled that he'd have a partner.
We don't know this guy at all.
Got to admit you're better than I thought.
Those idiots don't know what hit them.
Sit still.
At least give me some aspirin.
Oh! Come on.
Really? Oh, man.
Are you done yet? We gotta go.
I don't have the key.
What? My contact wasn't there.
Her shift starts at 8:00.
Tomorrow? So we're just gonna wait? You know, this wouldn't be such a big deal If you hadn't killed a cop.
Oh, he didn't know when to shut up.
You know what's gonna happen now? They're gonna put your picture everywhere.
They're gonna triple patrol.
You just screwed your chances of ever getting out of here.
Well, see, that's where you come in.
I got faith in you.
Is this gonna leave a scar? No, we gotta find schrader.
The team's got it covered.
Don't make me stay here.
I'm fine, honestly.
Pull this thing over.
Prentiss, you can't even focus.
You have a concussion.
I saw the guy.
White, 40s, I know.
Ok, so give me a cognitive interview.
Your adrenaline's pumping.
Exactly.
Emily, you're in shock.
It just happened.
It'll never be clearer.
How many shots did you fire? 3.
You emptied your clip.
No I did? All right, so schrader pulled a series of bank heists In the 1990s.
He was the only one to ever go away for the crimes.
He was a model prisoner, only served 11 of his 15 years, Was released early on good behavior, And any friends he had are either dead or still in prison.
A 3-ton truck was found north of the accident, Not too far from canada.
We have the heaviest presence at border crossings.
He probably knows that.
I don't think he's gonna sit still for long.
He might have to depending on how injured he is.
Rossi: What do we know? Dale schrader went to prison for robbery.
He was hands off.
All of his crimes were impersonal.
he kills stacy ryan And he kidnaps his daughter.
It's both personal and emotional.
When he's not attached to the crime, he pulls it off, But the minute he's invested, like with his daughter, He lets his guard down and gets caught.
It makes sense.
So he's not the hard-ass we thought he was.
But if jenny were what he wanted, He had her.
He could have left.
Yeah, we thought he took her and ran to canada, right? That theory made sense.
Why didn't he? Pictures from the accident.
Any word on emily? Apparently she's arguing with the doctors.
That's good.
This took a lot to pull off.
What if he's got a group of guys to call on? I agree.
All those bank jobs were a solo, But this is a lot for one man to orchestrate.
Jj: Figured out why he killed stacy ryan? We haven't found any connection to schrader, But he may be connected to the partner.
How? Killing her might have been advance payment For breaking him out of custody.
Garcia, I need everything you've got on stacy ryan.
What do you mean he got away? Somebody broke him out of custody.
Oh, god.
We're gonna keep the two of you here.
There's gonna be an officer standing watch the entire time.
If you can't find him, how long will you keep us safe? Ma'am, we will find him.
You don't know dale.
When he wants something, he gets it.
Can you think of anyone at all who might want to help him? He doesn't trust anybody.
It's not necessarily about trust.
Maybe somebody who's indebted to him And he was trying to collect on it? I don't know.
Jenny You and your dad were alone the entire time? Nobody was in the truck or the cabin? Nobody.
Who would do this for dale? Who would risk everything to help him? That's what we need to find out.
Stacy ryan had two times in her life-- When she was high and when she was waiting to get high.
The only thread I have between them Is that her brother spent time with schrader upstate like Why would schrader kill a junkie? It doesn't make sense.
Where's the brother now? Dead.
It doesn't feel like schrader does anything randomly.
Stacy must have meant something to him.
Garcia: Yeah, butWhat? Never mind, I see her.
I can take her from here.
Thanks.
Thk you.
I can walk.
Sit.
I like pushing you around.
[chuckles.]
Does it hurt? If by "it" you mean my entire body, then yes.
Ok, so the partner saw everything in the woods, He ran away and stole a truck? Who is this guy? He knew you were taking that road back to the station.
He waited for you and he crashed into you.
This whole thing feels meticulous.
Ok, so he needs the partner for something else.
For what, though? Well, I don't know.
I mean, he was locked up all this time.
He planned the whole day.
He should have had backup plans for his backup plans.
His ex shouldn't have been home for a few hours, So he clearly had enough time To get across the border with jenny until we showed up.
But he stayed local, holed up in that cabin.
He had what he wanted.
He could have just run.
There's gotta be something else keeping him in lockport.
I couldn't stop him from choking bunting.
Emily, don't do that.
He was right there.
Schrader's face is all over the news.
He's been on the run for almost 2 hours And we're no closer to catching him.
We need to find the partner.
Hey.
Prentiss: Hey.
How are you? I feel like I got hit by a truck.
Here, sit.
Thanks.
Uh, garcia, tell everyone what you just told me.
I have unearthed more of schrader's past.
Now, what we do know is that he robbed 15 banks In the state of new york in the nineties.
However, what your resident glamou r-puss smarty-pants just found out Was that most of that money was never recovered.
Reid: Where is it? My best guess-- only he knows.
Rossi: Good reason to stick around lockport.
Jj: The last robbery, the one that put him away, Should have been routine, right? So what happened? Morgan: Maybe someone turned him in.
Garcia: He kept to himself, always worked alone.
Who'd turn him in? We're missing somebody.
Garcia.
Yes, checking, sir.
What's this all about? Nothing to do till morning.
[chuckling.]
What's your problem? Hesitation puts obstacles in the path.
Boldness eliminates them.
Boldness strikes fear.
Fear creates authority.
"the 48 laws of power.
" you know it? You want to shoot me? Have I said thanks yet? Ok.
Records leading up to schrader's arrest Show this other bank robber Named dan otey.
And he was looking at copious amounts of time, Then he strikes a deal and all of a sudden schrader is arrested.
It can't be a coincidence.
You know, it's not uncommon for criminals to buy jobs Off one another.
Maybe that's what schrader did, But dan otey sold him out for a lesser sentence.
It doesn't make sense.
Otey was a rat and now he's the partner? Yeah, you're right.
Schrader wouldn't trust him.
If anything, he'd want him dead.
Probably, but he'd use him first.
He'd tell otey that he owes him one And that he might save his life if he helps him get out of this jam.
Where's he now, garcia? Uh, dan otey is a local.
He lives off of route 7.
Nobody's here.
Let's go.
Is your daddy home? Who are you? Man: Close the door! Don't do this.
Calm down.
I'm just gonna scare him a little bit.
Hey, dan! [screaming.]
You sent your son to the door? [gunshot.]
coward? His wife and son were home.
Are they ok? The partner took them upstairs While schrader destroyed the place.
Emily is with the wife right now.
[crying.]
Dan had turned everything around.
He was clean, life was finally good.
But I was always afraid to believe it, you know? Because then he could be taken away.
I'm so sorry.
The other man-- what did he look like? Uh, white Mid-40s Short hair I don't know.
Had you ever seen him before? Dale, yeah.
The other guy, no.
We're trying to figure out how schrader knows his partner.
I have no idea.
How did they talk to each other? They didn't.
Dale trashed the place, And the other guy took us upstairs.
He kept pushing me andJason.
I didn't know what was gonna happen.
Did he hurt you? He just scared us.
He locked us in the back room.
He locked you in the room and that's it? Yeah.
He told us to shut up and keep it locked.
But jason wouldn't stop crying.
This wasn't the deal.
Really? I didn't sign up to kill anybody.
You saved my ass.
You pulled me out of that car, remember? Then people died.
I can't do it.
I won't.
Yes, you will.
You terrorized that family.
You killed their father.
Don't worry.
The kid is young.
He won't remember him.
I also killed that cop.
Don't forget about him.
You enjoyed it.
Yes, I did.
And you didn't stop me.
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Ha ha ha ha ha! OohI get it.
OhhYou gotta do what you gotta do.
And I want what I want.
Come on, bro.
Almost done.
[chuckles.]
Schrader gets off on power.
That and money are what motivate him.
And revenge.
Who needs a partner, somebody as bold as him.
Reid: And where'd they meet? Schrader was away and patient.
The minute he got out, he hooked up with his partner first, And then he killed stacy ryan On his way to kidnap his daughter.
What's missing from his day? The money.
He took his daughter but left the money.
That doesn't make any sense.
Did he have another plan on how to support himself in canada? He's only known a life of crime.
He's incapable of change.
Time away proved that.
Well, otey's wife said that the partner locked them away, Like he didn't want them to get hurt.
He was protective.
That's weird, right? They're both dominant personalities, But they sound like they played good cop/bad cop.
Well, it's been 4 hours since the accident.
You still think I'm in shock? There's one way to find out.
Ok.
First thing, We go to the station, gonna get the key.
Then we go to the bank, which opens at 9:00.
Then we're done.
It's not that easy.
I told you.
Not for me.
But you-- everybody loves you.
Ok, I do this.
Then what? Then it's over.
No.
No? No.
There's no version of me surviving this.
You get what you want, I'm dead.
Well, if you believe that, do it.
Go ahead.
You can stop this right now.
You want me dead.
How bad? Come on.
Kill me.
What? You need my help? Is that what you need? You know I'm not gonna stop this Until I get what I want.
I'm not gonna stop it, but you can.
You want to end it? Then do it.
End it.
Come on.
Do it.
Take a chance that this all works out for you.
Come on! Come on! Do it! Come on! Come on! End it! Do it! Come on! Do it! That's what I thought.
It's not in you, joey.
Never was.
All right, take a deep breath, prentiss.
Let's just do this.
All right.
Tell me what you saw.
Was it dark? Yeah.
You were there.
You know it was.
Come on, now.
Ok.
What did it smell like inside the car? Sweat.
So you were hot? Yeah.
I--I opened the window a little bit.
It's really quiet.
Are there any other cars on the road? There's one coming.
What color is it? IIt's too bright.
Ok, but you looked at it.
You saw it.
It's a 4-door hybrid, black.
Where was schrader? He's looking out the window.
Was he waiting for something? Here comes another car.
A car or the truck? It's the truck.
Schrader sees it.
That's when it happens.
He'sOut of his seatbelt.
He's hunched over.
And he gets his cuffs out in front of him.
Ok, then what? Uh, bunting pulled over, And--and schrader put his seatbelt back on.
He knew it was coming.
Where did the truck come from? Uh, behind us.
Uh, no-- UhIt was in front of us.
Who was driving, prentiss? I don't know.
I can't see.
Ok.
It's all right, it's all right.
You're sure it was the truck? Yeah.
It's a big truck.
Think.
Who was driving? Who was driving? A white male, 40s.
All right, now your car stops rolling.
Yeah.
Um I'm pinned.
My seatbelt is jammed.
I can't breathe.
I can't see anything.
I can hear-- Oh, god, he's killing bunting.
But the partner's not there yet? No.
Where is he? He's running towards us.
What's he wearing? Jeans.
Boots.
What's wrong with you? You killed a cop? He's freaked out that bunting's dead.
Why would he care? I don't know.
But he won't let him kill me.
Give me the gun.
She's a fed.
She knows that there's two of us now.
And he keeps telling him to Put pressure on it.
On the bleeding.
Ok.
It's gonna be ok.
Wait.
He was talking to me.
There's a lot of blood.
Put pressure on it.
You're gonna be all right.
Understand? He knew we were on that road.
He was upset that bunting was dead.
He wouldn't let schrader kill me.
He kept telling me to put pressure on it.
And he was calm, like he's done this before.
He was helping me.
He took dan otey's family upstairs, Protected them from schrader.
Do we really think a good guy hooked up With a criminal like dale schrader? Voicemail: You have one saved message.
[beep.]
Joe, honey, it's me.
He got us.
All of us.
I don't know where we are.
God, I am so sorry.
Boy: Help us, daddy! Woman: Just do what he says, ok? Please just do whatever he says.
[beep.]
[beep.]
Joe, honey, it's me.
He got us.
You've almost got it.
You're doing so good.
[door opens and slams.]
I'm sorry.
Please.
Ohh! Oh, my god.
My god, please stop! Don't you touch him! It's not his fault.
I told him to do it.
No, wait! What are you doing? Mom! Mommy! No! Don't take my kid! Mom! Mommy! Mom, help! Stop! Mom! No [sobbing.]
mom! So how did schrader get this guy to sign on? Good people do bad things.
I'm just saying, it happens.
Right.
But this partner wouldn't let me die.
He protected otey's family.
In the same day, he helped a convicted felon escape custody.
His loyalties are all over the place.
The guy sounds desperate.
Maybe he needs some money.
I mean, schrader's got a lot of it still out there.
He could have promised him a cut.
Ah, I don't know.
He's an accomplice To 3 murders and a kidnapping.
Is there enough money out there For you to sign on to something like that? So it's something bigger than the money.
Um, maybe schrader's threatening him.
Leverage? It would have to be big.
We caught schrader because he kidnapped his daughter.
He was emotional and his guard was down.
Clearly, family means more to him than we thought.
Schrader's ex-wife forced him to give up custody of jenny.
Maybe he wants this guy to know what it feels like to lose his family, too.
It sounds like revenge to me.
Maybe it is.
You know what I just don't get? Why people think you're a hero.
I know something they don't.
You want to be just like me.
Honest men bore you.
They're too predictable.
And you'd rather die than be ordinary, So you take risks and you push the limits.
But you were raised to be a good guy.
It's in your blood.
You can't help it.
But that kills you a little bit.
That's why you had to figure out a way For a good guy to be bad, And that's how you got into my world.
Am I close? I want to talk to them.
You got your message and that picture.
How do I know you haven't killed them already? You have to trust me.
Whew.
Well, I'm disappointed.
But your wife and your kids are gonna be devastated 'cause they didn't have to die.
Look, you're gonna kill me.
There's no point in hurting them.
What kind of father are you? We've been over this.
I'm the only one who knows where they are.
As long as I'm alive, they're safe.
If you stop helping me, they're dead.
How's that? Anything on schrader's case? The usual suspects-- judge, lawyers.
They're all accounted for this morning.
If it's revenge, then it's gotta be someone who put him away.
Well, it's not the officers who arrested him Or the judge who sentenced him.
Then who is it? Garcia, I need the names of every law enforcement agent Involved in the schrader case.
You know everybody.
Yeah, but I want every single employee the year that he was arrested.
Ok, give me a minute.
Morgan: A whole minute? Come on, baby girl, what, Are you losing your touch? Oh, watch your pretty mouth.
Personnel records come at you now.
Who's still active? Reid: Most.
Would he risk using an active officer? Depends on how much he hates them.
Has anyone retired? Yeah, two of them.
Let's see- -matt massey, jeff messick.
Both married with kids, white, in their 50s.
Prentiss: Wait, can I see those pictures? No.
No.
Ohh.
Why wouldn't he go after one of the officers Who arrested him? It makes the most sense for revenge.
Hey, wait a minute, guys.
Listen to this.
There was a witness who never testified on schrader's behalf.
Schrader could see that as a betrayal.
He gets out of prison and uses him to get what he wants.
Garcia, I want you to run a history on a witness from the schrader case, Joey short.
Joey short.
Was born in '66 in nyc.
Didn't hold a lot of jobs except for construction.
In and out of rehab.
Morgan: Where is he now? His last known address was 10 years ago.
Did he do time? Mm-mmm.
No.
Come on, garcia.
People don't just disappear.
This guy's got a history with a lot of holes in it.
He went to rehab.
You know, maybe this guy had to walk the walk.
He was undercover.
That makes sense.
Those guys are up for anything, And they take big risks, professionally and personally.
It explains his behavior, too.
Good guy doing bad things.
Garcia, can you get us joey short's real name? It's not here.
Well, if schrader can find it, so can we.
The guy needed to be schrader's friend, So they're probably around the same age.
Look for academy graduates in the early nineties.
Ok.
Did any of them not go into police work? Baby, I don't follow you.
If he went undercover, then anything tied to the academy Would have to be severed.
I mean, the guy graduated, Be he had to immediately start working his history as joey short.
He went into construction, Made his contacts in the bank robbery world, And then he met schrader, Earned schrader's trust, And then turned him in and got out of the game.
Ok.
Here's a couple of guys look like they dropped out.
You got any pictures? Sending them your way now.
[beep beep.]
That is the guy.
That picture is 10 years old, but that's him.
That is joe muller.
He has a wife and 2 kids.
That's definitely the guy.
Where is he now? [buzz.]
betts.
Yes? [buzz.]
Joe muller.
Let me look at you.
How's life? It's a ride.
Molly, the kids? Good.
They're good.
What are you doing here? Just, uh, you know, working on an old case.
Uh, they stopped paying you, didn't they? Yes, ma'am.
Don't you ma'am me.
What do you need? Just, uh, 5 minutes? You got it.
You're the best.
[buzz.]
Ok, thanks.
Muller's not at home.
No one is.
His wife didn't show up at work, The kids weren't at school yesterday or today.
Schrader probably has them hostage.
Morgan: Yeah, but where? What could joe muller do for him? Reid: The only thing that's left.
He can get him the money.
Prentiss: Well, no one even knows where it is.
Reid: Schrader knows.
Jj: Where do these guys hide money? Reid: Someplace safe.
Jj: Would he be bold enough to hide it a safe deposit box? Reid: A thief using a bank? Yeah, maybe.
Jj: Schrader can't walk into a bank.
His face is everywhere.
No one would think twice if muller walked in.
Reid: He'd have to have a key.
Prentiss: Where's the physical evidence from the schrader case? We don't have it.
Well, if we can figure out where schrader hid the money, We'll know where he's going.
Hi.
[buzz.]
Thank you.
We're with the fbi.
We're working the dale schrader case.
Is joe muller helping you? No.
He was just here.
When? Thank you.
Where's my family? Hillcrest? You got them downtown? No, that's where my money is.
Then what? This is never gonna end, is it? Morgan: Stop the car! Put your hands where I can see them! Muller: Don't shoot.
Schrader, put it down! Prentiss: Put it down! You really gonna let me blow his brains out? Drop it or I'll shoot! What's wrong, agent? You still upset that I killed your buddy? Did he have kids like this one? Huh? Look at her.
She's pissed.
Don't kill him.
Look at that look in her eyes.
She's gonna.
She is gonna do it.
Come on, what are you gonna do?! Don't shoot.
Don't do it, schrader.
How's your arm? Hey! No! No! Where are they? Where's my family? Tell me where they are! Back up! Get away! Help him! Get away from him! Back off! She just killed my family.
You just killed my family! Calm down! You just killed my family! You killed my family! Calm down! Hey! Stop! The only person who knew where my family was And now he's dead.
I had every chance to kill him.
But I couldn't.
Because he had my family.
And this photograph is the only proof of life? Where's my phone? Joe, honey, it's me.
He got us.
All of us.
I don't know where we are.
God, I am so sorry.
Boy: Help us, daddy! Just do what he says, ok? Please just do whatever he says.
I'm gonna get garcia to trace this.
Unknown name, unknown number.
She might be able to help.
There was only one phone call? I tried to get him to let me talk to them again, but he wouldn't.
There must not be anyone there watching them.
So he hid a family where no one hears them call for help.
Someplace remote.
That cabin? No.
The locals tore it apart.
There's no one there.
Where are they? You saw schrader since he's had your family.
You saw something or heard it.
There's got to be some clue.
Prentiss: When was the last time you saw your family? Hold on, joe, I've got to get my phone.
Oh, uh, it's right here.
Oh.
Cold drains the battery.
I know.
Sorry.
Ok.
See you later, mrs.
Muller.
If you're lucky.
Hotch: You notice any cars on the street? Nothing.
[truck starts.]
let me get your seatbelt in.
[honk honk.]
Our routine's the same every day.
The kids have to be at school by 8:15, then molly heads to work.
She didn't make it to either yesterday.
What was her route? Uh, north on route 7, east on 22.
Is that route isolated during the morning commute? No.
If he was watching, there's a good chance she never left the driveway.
I drove out first.
[door closes.]
Drive.
I just left them there.
Reid: Where did he find you? At the hardware store.
I know who you are.
He told me how for 11 years He'd been trying to figure out how he got locked up.
He knew otey had ratted him out for the robbery, But that wasn't enough to put him away.
He said I was the piece that didn't fit.
He figured out I was a cop.
And he took your family.
Did you ever see this woman? Yeah.
I think she's some junkie.
I saw her right after he told me You help me, your family lives.
You don't, they die.
Pull over right up here.
Right here.
[truck door closes.]
Stacy.
I don't have time for this.
I told you, there'll be more when it's over.
I got some people helping and they don't want to wait.
That's not my problem.
[conversation inaudible.]
My brother said you were a son of a bitch.
You know what he's doing? Huh? You know what's in here? Huh? Hold on! [shouting.]
[stacy groans.]
Open the door.
Who is she? [stacy groaning.]
Go.
Come on.
Drive.
Go! You didn't know what she was talking about? No.
Pull over.
What are you gonna do with her? Hotch: He could have left the body in the alley.
Prentiss: Why didn't he? He didn't want to draw attention to that place.
Where was it? Uh, south of van wyck.
Bad area? Abandoned.
Junkies took over.
Perfect place to leave hostages.
Prentiss: Can you take us back there? Wait.
You think she knew about my family.
Her murder was the only thing that didn't fit, And now it makes sense.
Schrader killed her to shut her up.
Morgan: Rossi.
Turn around.
Turn around! Fbi.
Where are they? Give me the stuff, I'll tell you.
Where are the kids? What kids? Get him out of here.
He don't know nothin' else.
We're going up.
Come on, rossi.
Clear! Clear.
Clear.
[door breaks open.]
Molly? Hey.
The kids.
I'm so sorry.
Where are they? I don't know.
Where are the kids? I don't know.
Find them.
All right.
You're gonna be ok.
I got you.
Ok.
Ohh Clear! Clear! Rossi.
Hey.
Hey, little man.
Hey, it's ok.
It's ok.
Go get muller.
Your dad's looking for you.
We're gonna get you out of here.
It's gonna be ok, all right? We're getting your dad right now.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you ok? [bottle rattling.]
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Ok.
Ok.
How you doing? Can I pick you up? Ok.
Ok.
Come here, sweetheart.
Oh, I got you.
Prentiss: Washington irving said, "there is a sacredness in tears.
"they are not the mark of weakness, but of power.
"they are messengers of overwhelming grief And of unspeakable love.
" You got a sec? Come in.
I just wanted to say That you exceeded all expectations leading this team.
Mine and everyone else's.
So have you, hotch.
You showed the skill and confidence of a natural leader, AndI thank you for it.
Of course.
I get why you're back.
Do you? You were never going to sit behind a desk.
You know why? Because your son knows that you get the bad guys.
And if you're not out there trying to catch them, what's he going to think? Well, tonight he's gonna think I wasn't there at bedtime.
You're his hero, hotch.
I, uh, figured I'd save you a couple hours.
You don't have to do that anymore.
I know I don't.
But I also know what it's like to be raised by a single parent.
Every minute counts.
So if you need me to make that a regular thing, I'd be more than happy to.
I appreciate that.
I really do.
Good night.
Good night.
