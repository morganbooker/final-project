This is a special report from la plata county, colorado.
We're reminded of jim mckay's words from munich-- Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized.
Let's hope it's not the latter as we wait to hear the fate of the women, children, And f.
b.
i.
agents inside the building.
Jim, are you getting this? 3 days earlier POSTED NO TRESPASSING KEEP OUT He comes into my bedroom and lays with me.
He says it's god's will.
I'm only 15.
And i'm not the only one.
Please help me! La Plata County COLORADO Tell us about the 9-1-1 call.
I believe the he that they referred to is the church's leader, benjamin cyrus.
Benjamin cyrus-- no criminal record.
No record at all, really.
What else do you know about him? It's rumored that he's practicing polygamy and forced marriages.
Any idea who the caller is? Uh, jessica evanson is the one who the age fits, but We can't be sure.
So i negotiated interviews with all the children.
It wasn't easy.
Well, considering their view on outsiders, It would be best if you didn't identify us as f.
b.
i.
just use our real names, And introduce us as child victim interview experts.
I'm looking for mr.
Benjamin cyrus.
You found him.
I'm nancy lunde.
We spoke on the phone regarding the allegation.
Savages, the call us.
'Cause our manners differ from theirs.
We didn't come here to hear you cite scripture, mr.
Cyrus.
Actually, it's benjamin franklin.
Emily prentiss, spencer reid.
They're child victim interview experts.
How far from god's word must we have strayed for there to be the need to invent a job called child victim interview expert? We wish we didn't have to be here.
So do we.
But you are welcome, nonetheless.
The children are in the school as i indicated.
Thank you.
You're using solar power? Yeah.
We're completely self-sufficient-- electricity, food, water.
Ben franklin said, god helps those that helps themselves.
You look surprised.
No Impressed, actually.
Thank you.
For what? For admitting that.
We go to school.
We do our chores.
And we treat ourselves and each other with the respect god demands.
But you've never been off of the ranch? I brought jessie here when she was 2.
You've talked to lots of children in your work.
Tell me their lives somehow better than ours? We devote ourselves to god.
That doesn't mean we're not devoted to our children.
We are not here because of your religious beliefs.
Why are you here? We received a phone call alleging that an adult male member of your church was having inappropriate relations with the younger women here.
You're talking about cyrus.
- What makes you say that? - Jessie, come on.
Is it inappropriate for a husband to share a bed with his wife? You are married to cyrus? Yes.
Cyrus is my husband and a prophet.
It's an honor to bare his children.
Jessica, you're 15 years old.
The state of colorado requires parental consent.
She gave consent.
Get up! Get up! You heard him! Stand! What's going on? We just got a very strange phone call from a news reporter.
Is there anything you want to tell me about a raid maybe? They don't know.
Chapel, straight ahead.
School to the left.
Team one hit the school.
Team 2 hit the chapel.
State police! We have a warrant! Clear! Team one to team 2.
Be advised the school is empty.
We have not secured the children.
Hit it again! Hit it again! We have a hatch.
It's a tunnel! - What's going on? - I don't know.
Just stay calm.
They knew we were coming.
Out! Out! Move out! All right, move quietly.
Quickly go to the left.
Everybody stay together.
Children listen to your parents.
All right, everyone.
Down to this end.
Have faith.
Where'd all these guns come from? I don't know.
Garcia checked with the state police.
Stay together.
Remain calm.
Everyone remain calm.
There is nothing to fear here.
This is ridiculous.
It's ok.
Just calm down.
What's going on? They're trying to breach the front door.
All right.
Remain calm.
Stay quiet.
God will protect you.
Cease fire! Cease fire! Get the door open! It's the state police.
I'm an officer of the state.
Well, there's nothing we can do right now.
I can talk to him.
No, you can't.
It's dangerous.
Nancy, stop! Nancy! Go away! We have women and children here.
Please! Cease fire! Cease fire! Mr.
Cyrus, let me talk to them.
Do not fear.
We are on the side of the righteous.
Where's lunde? It wasn't us.
What? You can't shoot it out with the cops! You have children here.
I didn't start this.
I'll take the roof.
You take the tunnel.
Rear.
The hatch! Man down! Man down! We can't stay here! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! We're giving you a chance to pull back! Please, take it! Bower's hit bad.
Ok.
We're pulling back.
Pull back! They're pulling out! They're pulling out! Not for long.

- What's up? What is reportedly being called a routine questions And answers meeting by colorado child services had turned into a violent and deadly standoff Between colorado authorities and a fringe religious group known as the sepatarian sect.
J.
j.
, that's not the ranch where prentiss and reid-- They're still inside.
Hotch! Tactical warrant service team into a forced retreat after losing a 30-minute gun battle The tv.
Prentiss and reid.
No one knows for sure how many people are inside.
It is believed at least 3 of the child service members are still trapped within the compound.
All right that means we're the lead with hostage rescue and support.
Let's go.
Turned deadly when the colorado state police officers tried to serve a warrant.
Colorado attorney general jim wells says the reclusive cult has been the subject of a - We didn't check? - No.
We checked.
I had a.
t.
f.
Call wells.
He told a.
t.
f.
There were no pending state investigations.
He lied.
Why? Wells is challenging the governor in the next election.
He thought that a.
t.
f.
Was about to poach his big election-launching weapons bust.
Now it's clear he didn't know there were f.
b.
i.
agents there.
He just thought the best time to serve a state warrant was When the kids were safe inside the school being interviewed.
What do we know about this sect? Liberty ranch was founded in He created it as a self-sustaining commune.
Libertarians believe that everyone has the right to do what they want As long as they aren't infringing on the rights of others.
But libertarians aren't religious.
Clearly this sect abandoned libertarian principles.
Benjamin cyrus, the current leader, introduced religion 8 years ago when kane left.
Garcia, what do we got on cyrus? We got bubkiss.
It's like the guy never cast a shadow on the known universe.
However his predecessor, leo kane, is doing a 17-year stretch at deerfield federal prison.
Apparently libertarians do not like paying taxes.
Oh, no.
That would be and 15 for going after 4 ir.
s.
agents with a louisville slugger.
Let's have kane brought to the scene.
He's our best chance at finding out some idea of who we're dealing with.
Miles is dead.
He was locking the door when they shot him.
Lauren and robert were asleep in their bed.
The bullets came through the wall.
What about the baby? I have her.
She was at the school.
Hello, darling.
It's all gonna be all right, honey.
Mommy and daddy have gone to god.
Ok? It's all gonna be all right.
Take her to the temple and pray.
Distribute weapons and ammo.
I prayed this day would never come.
But it has.
God will see us through.
Dave, they've left the choice of negotiators up to me.
I taught most of the hostage negotiation unit.
You want a recommendation? I'm making you the lead negotiator.
Me? Why go to the students when i have the teacher? Because the teacher is emotionally involved.
So is the agent in command.
I know i am.
This is a unique situation.
We have 2 agents who could affect the outcome on the inside.
True.
But i can't be objective! I know them too well.
This outcome depends as much on our ability to predict the moves of prentiss and reid as cyrus.
That's why you're the best man for the job.
Assuming that reid and prentiss are still in a condition to make moves.
I know how bad this is.
That's why i want you doing the talking.
- All right.
- You're obviously not in charge.
I can see that! i'm sorry, sir.
I'm under direct orders from the f.
b.
i.
I'm the attorney general of this state.
I demand to know why i wasn't told that the f.
b.
i.
Was sending undercover agents into the septarian ranch.
The only thing that you're in the position to demand is lawyer.
Who the hell are you? I'm aaron hotchner, unit chief.
I'm the guy who's gonna tell the attorney general of the united states Whether to charge you with obstructing a federal investigation or negligent homicide.
You can't talk to me like that.
Get off my crime scene.
- You know dave rossi.
- Sure.
We've been here before, haven't we? Waco.
Ruby ridge.
Freeman stand off.
Let's hope someone listens to you guys this time.
Oh, they did more than listen.
They put us in charge.
So bring us up to speed.
I've sent the state police packing.
They started this mess.
Lost a man in the process.
Hope that's ok.
- If you hadn't.
We would've.
- Good.
County sheriffs have had no run-ins with the sect.
So we're using them as support.
We've had no contact with them so far.
They've got power--solar.
We can shoot out the panels if you think-- no.
No.
That's an escalation.
Ok.
But that means they have access to the news.
I'll get j.
j.
to talk to the press.
Your men ready to be briefed? Let's go.
We call this the "minimal loss scenario.
" Every person we get out is a life saved.
We won't save them all.
All of us have to be prepared to accept that situation.
Cults are structured like pyramids.
You got the leader at the top.
Diehard believers beneath.
The biggest group-- the base--followers.
Woman and children.
These are the people we can save.
The "trickle, flow, gush" strategy is designed to get base followers out.
First, one or two.
Then 3 or 4.
Then as many as we can as fast as we can.
And if at any point it starts to go bad, we go in.
The leaders are charismatic sociopaths who target those most susceptible to their seduction.
They have the ability to see what each person needs.
And then they become that thing.
We have to undermine their perception that we're an invading army laying siege to their home.
We'll lose the fatigues.
Will rancher's clothes work for ya? Like we did at the freeman stand off? Perfect.
Anything we can do to demilitarize the situation.
Hello? You killed my mom and daddy.
Are you going to kill me to? No one is going to kill you, honey.
This is benjamin cyrus.
Who am i talking to? David rossi, an f.
b.
i.
agent.
We sent the state police away.
There's just us and the local sheriff.
All we want to do is resolve this before anyone else gets hurt.
Then leave us alone.
I'm afraid we can't do that, benjamin.
One of the police bled out on the way to the hospital.
So let's just stop this before things get worse.
Please, just put down your guns and come out.
We're believers, dave.
We believe that god says what he means and means what he says.
His laws don't depend on what state you live in.
I have no issue with your beliefs.
You don't.
But the state does.
I can't answer for other people.
Oh, god will answer for everyone in the final battle i've foreseen.
That's why i'm here-- to make sure that this is not that battle.
We shall see.
Now, the 3 child services workers One of them is dead.
It wasn't us.
I need a name to inform the family.
Her name was nancy lunde.
Ok.
Now, please, benjamin, send out your wounded.
I promise you they'll be well taken care of.
With enough supplies we can tend to our own.
Ok.
I need a few hours to put it together.
I'll bring them up myself at first light.
They could take you hostage.
I'm gonna confirm the kids, prentiss, and reid are ok.
Rossi, at least let me go with you.
No.
This is about building trust.
I go alone.
I want the parabolic arc mics fixed on every window in that structure.
They won't pick up much.
They have blinds on all the windows.
Unless they're shouting, the glass won't vibrate enough for us to get an audio.
Well, if they're not shouting, these bugs will pick 'em up, at least until the batteries die.
How familiar are agents prentiss and reid with our playbook? The b.
a.
u.
wrote the cirg handbook.
They'll know that we're trying to get ears in there at all times.
Good.
Let's hope they can get these people talking.
They will.
Dave? I'm ben.
Come on in.
The children.
And our guests.
I'd hoped you'd let me take the children.
Nah, their our protection.
I remember waco.
We all do.
This isn't waco.
They stay for now While i pray for god's guidance.
Please don't try to force us out.
No one's gonna try to force you out of here.
Trust me.
Trust is earned.
It is.
Tell them i'm not crazy.
Tell them i'm just a man living by god's law.
I will.
Prepare the wine.
We are celebrating.
Everyone drinks.
Everyone rejoices.
Because today we are one day closer to being with him.
Look at jessica's body language.
The way she looks at him.
She literally worships him.
There's no way she made that 9-1-1 call.
Trust in god with all your heart.
Lean not on your own understandings.
Trust in mine.
Look how she comes between cyrus and her daughter.
She's inserted herself between them.
Acknowledge him in all things, and he will guide your way.
Drink to acknowledge him.
And i will guide our way.
Reid and prentiss are ok.
What about cyrus? He's too calm.
It's--it's like he was waiting for this to happen.
And now that it has, he feels vindicated.
I got a signal.
I'm getting a signal here.
We will be with him soon.
We have drank the poison together.
Mothers Fathers Children, though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we fear no evil.
For thou are with us.
This doesn't fit.
I looked him in the eye.
He was calm, lucid.
They're committing mass suicide.
We don't know that for sure.
- Rossi, he just said it.
- We're ready to go.
If we go in there, people are going to die.
People are already dying.
And god will wipe the tears from their eyes, and there will be no more death nor sorrow nor crying.
And there will be no more pain.
For all of the former things have passed away.
- What do we do? - Nothing.
We have to do something.
These people just took poison.
Cyrus just told them he did.
I think he's just bluffing.
Why do you think that? Just after he told them about the poison, he waited for them to start to react.
Then he nodded to cole.
And he started writing.
Look.
They're scanning the audience looking for reactions.
They're writing down the names of the people who are crying.
It's a loyalty list.
So he knows who will follow him to the end.
Jim jones pulled the same stunt! They did a test run just like this years before they did the real thing.
Prepare your men to go in.
Be still.
There was no poison.
Dan Instead a test of faith.
Because your adversary, the devil, waltzes about as a roaring lion! Choosing whom he may devour.
Watch each other for signs of weakness.
You are your brother's keeper.
- Tell 'em to stand down.
- Yes, sir.
Nice call.
Former sect leader is here.
I got it.
Charles mulgrew is his real name.
Charles mulgrew.
His mother was 5 months pregnant when she showed up at our doorstep.
He turned out to be one of the smart ones.
Amazing memory that kid had.
Anything he read he could repeat back to you.
And he did.
Mouthy little son of a bitch.
Why'd he leave the ranch? When he was 17 a couple of our young girls came to me and said that he'd been messing with them.
You mean sexually? Yes, sir.
I do.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I'm a libertarian.
But Those little girls were too young for a 17 year old to be messing with.
So you kicked him out for that? Yes, sir.
I did.
His mother took him to kentucky.
Hadn't heard anything from him for years.
And then when he finally showed up again, he said his mother had died, He found god, and he wanted to come home.
How does a kid like that get rid of you? One day he came to me and said god told him that i should leave the ranch.
I said if god felt that way, god can tell me himself.
He put a gun to my head and said, he just did.
Took me 20 years to build that ranch.
I'll do anything i can to help you seed that ungrateful son of a bitch straight to hell.
I need a map.
Charles mulgrew--convicted in kentucky at the age of 18.
So we need to talk to the warden? Way ahead of you, honey.
Mr.
Kentucky warden said that once inside, mulgrew found religion, became a model citizen.
Well, it's not that hard to behave when you're in protective custody the whole time.
General population's a rough place for a child molester.
No.
No.
I don't think you guys understand.
He was a model citizen.
This guy volunteered at the prison hospital-- the aids ward-- He was reading to prisoners dying of H.
I.
V.
Good stuff.
Damn straight.
Now get our friends back, baby.
Well, this makes things worse.
What? That he was a model citizen? That he's been to prison.
He knows what happens to child molesters there.
If the current sexual allegations are true and he thinks we know it, he's not coming out of there.
Then we have to make him think he's not going back.
J.
J.
, I need you to release a press statement saying that we have absolutely no evidence of sexual allegations.
You need to see this.
Now well into its second day, the standoff at the sepatarian sect ranch has now been taken over by the F.
B.
I.
There was much speculation in regard to hostages.
But anonymous sources inside the state attorney general's office have told us There is an undercover f.
b.
i.
agent currently being held inside the sepatarian sect ranch.
Hostage negotiators say they are making headway with the sect's leadership And are hopeful for a positive outcome.
There's still no word as to why an undercover F.
B.
I.
agent was sent in alone.
Which one of you is it? Which one of you is the F.
B.
I.
agent? Why do you think one of us is an F.
B.
I.
Agent? God will forgive me for what i must do.
I--i don't know what you're talking about.
One of you does.
Who is it? Me.
It's me.
I told you not to put me in this position! - We gotta go in there.
- We'd be risking the lives everyone in there.
Get up! Proverbs 20:30 tells us blows and wounds cleanse away evil.
I can take it.
Oh, you can take it? Wait--wait.
Listen to what she's saying.
I can take it.
She's antagonizing him.
She's not talking to him.
She's talking to us.
She's telling us not to come in.
Pride comes before the fall.
Tie her up.
Put her upstairs.
You should have told cyrus who you were.
He's a prophet.
He predicted satan's armies would come and lay siege to us.
There's a name for that kind of prophecy-- self fulfilling.
You don't know how dangerous it is to lie to him.
I know it would take a brave woman to defy him, knowing the consequences.
And that that woman would have to have a damn good reason to do it.
Did you know she was F.
B.
I? Nancy told me the woman was a child abuse interview expert from denver.
In 4 years i worked with her, nancy never lied to me before.
As far as you know.
Their law says that a said a 14 year old was an adult.
Have children changed so much in 50 years? I can't tell you the number of times i've investigated abuse charges against small religious groups.
Almost all of them turn out to be false.
What do you think of that? Doesn't really matter what i think.
- It does to me.
- Why? Because god wants to save you.
I mean, that's why he sent you here.
That's the reason.
On the next call, you should test them.
Test the negotiator.
Make him prove that he isn't a liar.
How would you suggest i do that? Ask for the identity of the F.
B.
I.
agent.
No.
We already know her identity.
- They don't know that.
- Yeah.
But the F.
B.
I.
would never tell us.
They keep on asking you to release people.
Tell him you'll release a kid, and you won't harm the agent.
And if they really care about the children, they'll have to tell you.
You're trying to get us to release a child.
It's one kid.
If they don't hold up on their end of the deal, you know they can't be trusted.
He has a point.
Reid has him.
What is it, christopher? Some have been talking about Leaving.
- Leaving? - Yeah.
Wake the baby.
Let's let them meet the orphan that they've made.
How you doing today, ben? I will release a child if you tell me the identity of the F.
B.
I.
agent.
I promise no harm will come to them from this point forward.
I can't give you that information.
I will send the child now.
Hey, it's ok.
It's ok.
Come to me, sweetie.
You're safe now.
We got her, hotch.
We're taking a big risk here, ben.
Trust is earned.
Her name name is emily prentiss.
She came in with 2 child service workers to talk to the girls.
There's a good chance we can work this out, dave.
I'm gonna provide another sign of good faith.
You're doing a good thing here.
Assemble everyone in the chapel.
Get agent prentiss down here.
It has come to my attention that some of our brothers and sisters have lost their faith in god.
That they no longer love us.
They want to abandon us.
So when i call out your name, please stand.
Todd sutters.
Melanie sutters He looks pissed.
Evan radley.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm so sorry.
Sean ebbins.
Sherry Look at who he's releasing.
Wyatt rayborn.
It's the ones who failed the loyalty test.
Doris beasley.
We'll get word to the team.
Wait for a sign from outside to indicate what time the raid will come.
Willis farwell.
I told her she shouldn't have lied to you like that.
To either of us.
Take her back.
Those of you that are standing, please collect your belongings And report to the front hallway immediately.
We will surrender tomorrow at noon.
I want the press there to insure that we're treated fairly.
We'll discuss the details in our 7:00 A.
M.
call.
- I'll see you then, dave.
- I look forward to it.
Oh, and one more thing.
Could you send some food in.
Sure.
What would you like? Fried chicken, all the fixin's.
You got it.
I don't understand.
Why did you let them go? They weren't prepared to do what needs to be done.
You're not one of us.
You don't know what it takes to be prepared.
Listen to him.
Tell him.
They failed the test.
They--they had a chance to prove their faith when cyrus told them That they'd sacrifice themselves for god.
But instead they showed they weren't worthy.
That's why he wants the media to bare witness to your true final act of sacrifice.
How do you know that? I'm always looking for signs of things to come.
Reid's talking to us.
He wants a sign when we're coming in.
He's telling us this is it.
Time has run out.
We've got to go in.
Drugging the food is not an option because of the children.
We have to go in.
Best time to hit 'em is when they're least mentally prepared.
at their low point then.
We need a diversion.
Something that plays into his expectations.
- Cyrus brought up waco.
- Right.
I know exactly how to use that.
We need some humvees.
The plan depends on reid and prentiss separating the diehards from the followers.
And delaying cyrus's diehards from reacting to our assault.
That's not my main concern.
Reid and prentiss know what they need to do.
So what is your concern? Letting them know when we're coming.
The whole things hinges on them being ready for us at 3:00 A.
M.
Come on, guys, quick.
We need to get those bugs in the boxes before it gets too cold.
Perfect.
Let's hope it's just that easy.
If you can hear me, i know you're coming.
I can try to get the women and children down to the tunnel, But i need to know when you're coming.
- What is it? - Prentiss.
She's talking to us.
If you can hear me i know you're coming.
I can try to get the women and children down to the tunnel, But i need to know when you're coming.
Let's go.
I can try to get the women and children down to the tunnel, But i need to know when you're coming.
But i need to know when you're coming.
If you can hear me, i know you're coming.
I can-- Ok.
ok.
I got you.
What time? What time? Understood.
Reid is on the first floor somewhere with cyrus.
And please remember there are children here.
Someone's coming.
Hold on, emily.
I know what you're thinking.
You don't have to be a part of this.
You can go.
I think i'd prefer to stay.
Somebody needs to tell your story.
And i'm glad it'll be you.
Now that the false believers have been cleared from our midst, we make our final preparations.
Cyrus is planning a mass suicide.
You made the This is all my fault.
None of this would have happened if i hadn't of made that call.
You were trying to protect your daughter.
There were other girls before jessie.
He--he would marry them in secret.
And after a while, he'd take another.
And we weren't permitted to speak of it.
And so when she asked for my consent, i wanted to just take her and run.
But i was afraid she wouldn't leave him.
You wanted us to take her? Well, i--i wanted to save her from cyrus.
I can give you another chance.
The F.
B.
I.
is coming here at 3:00 A.
M.
I need you to gather jessica, the kids, the other women-- Get them into the basement just before 3:00 A.
M.
Why are you telling me this? Because i have faith that you are a strong enough woman to do the right thing for jessica.
I know i can't go in there.
I'm going.
If something happens to prentiss or reid, i I don't know.
You're not alone.
- What is it? - Come on.
Come on.
You were right.
They're setting the place to blow up.
I told jessie cyrus wanted her gather the women and children.
Where is the man i came in with? He's in the chapel with cyrus.
It's 2:45 though.
We gotta hurry.
Something's wrong.
They lied to us.
Should we do it now? No.
Let 'em get closer.
Cyrus, what are you doing? Making sure the press is watching.
They're gonna want to see this.
This is it.
The moment of faith.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
It came from inside the building.
Go check the fuses.
Go.
Emily, you all right? They've wired explosives.
Everybody come on.
- Let's go this way.
- Let's go kids.
Ok.
This building's gonna blow up.
Where's reid? - He's in the chapel with cyrus.
- We gotta get you out of here.
- No.
We've gotta get reid! - Prentiss, i will get reid.
Get out of here.
Get to safety.
Go now.
