PREVIOUSLY ON CRIMINAL MINDS THIS UNSUB KILLS IN 2- AND 3-DAY CYCLES.
WHICH MEANS HE'S ABOUT TO GO BACK OUT THERE.
I GOT HOME FROM IRAQ.
MY BABY SISTER LEE WAS MISSING.
I FOUND HER ON THE STREETS.
I GOT HER HOME, GOT HER CLEANED UP.
SHE EVEN WORE MY DOG TAGS FOR GOOD LUCK.
SHE SLIPPED BACK ONTO THE STREETS AND HAS BEEN MISSING SINCE.
WE HAVE ANOTHER REPORTED MISSING.
[SOBBING.]
AAH! [SOBBING.]
STOP! NO! NO! [CRYING.]
NO! NO! [CRYING.]
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE? YOU ARE MASON TURNER? DR.
TURNER.
THIS IS MY SISTER, LEE HIGHTOWER.
HAS SHE BEEN HERE? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WE'RE WITH THE FBI.
WE'VE BEEN INVITED BY THE RCMP TO ASSIST IN AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN INVITED INTO MY HOME.
MY CANADIAN HOME.
NOW GET THE HELL OUT BEFORE I CALL THE PROPER AUTHORITIES.
SIR, WE'VE BEEN INVITED BY THE PROPER AUTHORITIES.
TELEPHONE, DIAL NUMBER 911.
[COMPUTER DIALING.]
Dispatcher: 911.
WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY? THIS IS DR.
MASON TURNER, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
I WANT THESE PEOPLE OUT OF MY HOME.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO BE HERE.
AGENT ROSSI, AGENT HOTCHNER, MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU, PLEASE? OHH! OH [SOBBING AND PANTING.]
AAH! NO! [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS.]
AAH! AAH! [GRUNTING.]
HELP ME! AAH! AAH! COME ON! [SNORTING.]
[PIG SQUEALING.]
[SQUEALING.]
[FAINT.]
HELP ME! DID YOU HEAR THAT? WHAT? WAS THAT A SCREAM? ANYTHING? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DIRECTION IN CAME FROM.
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON I HATE THESE DAMN WOODS.
IT MESSES WITH THE SOUND.
YOU SAID THIS WOULD BE THE UNSUB.
EVERYTHING POINTS TO HIM, INSPECTOR.
THE PROFILE WAS RIGHT.
DOES THAT MAN LOOK CAPABLE OF ABDUCTING ANYONE? RELAX, JEFF.
I LET A SUSPECT WHO TRIED TO KILL MY BORDER AGENTS OUT OF JAIL, A MAN WHO ACTUALLY CONFESSED TO THE CRIMES WE'RE INVESTIGATING, BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU.
AND YOU WERE WRONG.
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE SENSE INITIALLY.
NO.
I'M TAKING MY PRISONER BACK TO THE STATION, AND YOU CAN ALL GO HOME.
EXCUSE ME.
[WHISPERING.]
Pretty.
WHAT'S THIS THING? I DON'T KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT PIG FARMS AS YOU MIGHT THINK.
PRENTISS.
THAT'S A HANDPRINT.
THAT LOOKS LIKE BLOOD.
OH, MY GOD.
HOTCH! THERE'S A BOX NEXT TO THE PIGS-- IT'S LIKE A GARBAGE BIN OR SOMETHING.
IT'S FULL OF NOTHING BUT BLOODY SHOES, ALL DIFFERENT SIZES, MALE AND FEMALE.
WE SAID WE WERE LOOKING FOR 10 MISSINGS? THERE'S GOTTA BE OVER IN THAT THING.
THESE ARE THEY BELONG TO VICTIMS? POSSIBLY.
WHY JUST THE SHOES? WHERE ARE THE BODIES? Reid: I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY BODIES, GUYS.
PIGS ARE OMNIVORES.
THEY'LL EAT ANYTHING.
BY ANYTHING, I MEANANYTHING.
WHAT HAPPENED? I'M GOING TO TAKE THESE CUFFS OF YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON? UHWE'RE STILL NOT SURE, WILLIAM.
DID YOU FIND MY SISTER? NO.
BUT WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF SHOES SHE WAS WEARING WHEN SHE WENT MISSING? SHOES? NO-- IS BEDWELL ALL RIGHT? HE WILL BE.
HE HAS EVERY AVAILABLE COP IN ONTARIO ON THE WAY HERE.
YOU FIND ANYONE IN THE HOUSE? MASON TURNER.
IS HE IN CUSTODY? UH, NOT EXACTLY.
BUT HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
HE'S QUADRIPLEGIC.
PARALYZED FROM THE NECK DOWN.
JJ's IN THERE WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.
WELL, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD CRIMINAL DEFENSE.
I'LL GO TALK TO HIM.
MORGAN, DO YOU HAVE THE CONTACT NUMBER FOR THE DETROIT DETECTIVE? BENNING? YEAH.
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA NEED THEIR OPEN MISSINGS SO WE CAN MAKE IDENTIFICATIONS ON THIS PROPERTY.
RIGHT.
I THINK THAT LAPTOP IS HIS SOLE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE.
WHICH MEANS DATA FILES ON HARD DRIVES, RECORDS.
[DIALING CELL PHONE.]
B.
A.
U.
TECH CENTER, WHERE YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PAY ATTENTION TO THE GIRL BEHIND THE CURTAIN.
GARCIA, I NEED YOU IN ONTARIO A.
S.
A.
P.
AT THE FARMHOUSE THAT THE UNSUB'S CAR WAS REGISTERED TO.
YES, SIR.
WHAT SHOULD I BRING? WE NEED FORENSIC RECOVERY FROM A LAPTOP.
I'LL TELL YOU MORE WHEN YOU GET HERE.
I DON'T WANT THIS OVER THE PHONE.
AND THE NEXT FLIGHT, GARCIA.
OK.
ON MY WAY.
OH, MY.
NOT OVER THE PHONE.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BE IN KANSAS ANYMORE.
REID, WILL YOU LET BEDWELL KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED A WARRANT TO EXAMINE THE LAPTOP AND THE HARD DRIVES.
REID.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE? TO GET A WARRANT? NO.
FOR THE PIGS TO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND CONDITION OF THE BODY WHEN IT'S PLACED IN THE PEN, IT WOULDN'T BE QUICK.
WHY? THAT MEANS KELLY WASN'T PUT IN THERE.
SHE'S STILL HERE SOMEWHERE.
[MOANING.]
[GASPS.]
OHH! [MOANING.]
HEY.
MY PARENTS ARE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR ME.
THEY'RE IMPORTANT PEOPLE.
DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU BETTER LET ME GO.
[GRUNTING.]
I'M SERIOUS! YOU'RE GONNA BE IN BIG TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T.
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?! [GROWLING.]
I'M SORRY! AAH! OH, I'M SORRY.
[CHOKES.]
I THINK-- [GASPS.]
[COUGHING AND VOMITING.]
THEY'RE GONNA NEED SOME HELP OUTSIDE.
YES, SIR.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN OUT THERE? YOU KNOW WHAT WE FOUND.
HOW COULD I? YOU SEE I'M PARALYZED.
HEY.
DON'T TOUCH THAT.
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S OUT THERE.
YOU WATCHED THE WHOLE THING.
PUT THAT BACK.
YOU LIKE WATCHING, DON'T YOU? THIS IS NOT YOUR JURISDICTION.
OH, I'M NOT GONNA ARREST YOU.
STOP THAT! PHONE.
DIAL NUMBER-- NO-- YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING TO YOU.
IN FACT, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK TO ME.
AS YOU SAID, I HAVE NO JURISDICTION HERE.
BUT, ALMOST EVERY POLICEMAN IN ONTARIO IS ON THEIR WAY TO THIS FARM, AND THEY DO HAVE JURISDICTION.
SOME VERY BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED HERE, AND THEY'RE GONNA DISCOVER ALL OF IT.
NOW, MASON HOW MANY VICTIMS WERE THERE? MORE? DO YOU EVEN KNOW FOR SURE? I NEED MY MIRRORS.
NO.
WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU LOOK LESS LIKE THE MONSTER THAT WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU REALLY ARE.
HOW CAN YOU CALL ME THAT? I'VE NEVER LAID A HAND ON ANYBODY.
YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS BEFORE HE KILLS KELLY, YOUR LATEST VICTIM.
SO, HOW MUCH TIME DOES SHE HAVE, MASON? HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE BEFORE I'M UNABLE TO SAY THAT YOU HELPED ME? NO, NO, NO, NO.
I THINK I HAVE A CONCUSSION.
I NEED A HOSPITAL.
NO HOSPITAL! I WON'T TELL THEM ABOUT YOU.
JUST DROP ME OFF.
HOSPITALS ARE BAD PLACES! I REALLY NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.
MASON SAYS NO HOSPITALS! NEVER NO HOSPITAL! OK.
OK, NO HOSPITAL.
IT WAS MY BROTHER LUCAS.
HE'S CRAZY.
HE DID ALL OF IT.
HE DID THIS TO ME, TOO.
I WANTED TO TRY TO STOP HIM.
HOW COULD I? WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL FOR HELP? I TRIED THAT ONCE, BUT HE FOUND OUT.
HE BEAT ME.
HE ALMOST KILLED ME.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE COMPLETELY VULNERABLE TO SOMEONE WHO'S CAPABLE OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE.
WHERE IS HE RIGHT NOW? OH, I WISH I COULD HELP YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES WHEN HE LEAVES ME HERE.
HE HAS A GIRL WITH HIM.
A YOUNG GIRL FROM DETROIT.
THEN YOU SHOULD PRAY FOR HER.
THERE'S A PICTURE OF HIM IN THE OTHER ROOM.
IT WAS TAKEN YEARS AGO, BUT IT STILL LOOKS LIKE HIM.
I SHOULD WARN YOU HE'S CRAZY AND VERY BIG.
INHUMANLY STRONG.
WHEN YOU FIND HIM, YOU SHOULD WARN EVERYONE IF THEY DON'T KILL HIM FIRST, HE'LL KILL ALL OF YOU.
[SIRENS.]
GOOD.
YEAH.
GOOD.
YEP.
JUDGE WILL SIGN THE WARRANT FOR THE LAPTOP FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
OUR TECH SHOULD JUST BE GETTING THERE THEN.
WE GOT SEARCH-AND-RESCUE UNITS COMING.
THEY'RE ALSO OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM, SO THEY'LL BE ARMED IN CASE WE COME ACROSS SOMETHING.
WHEN THIS HITS THE PRESS, FAMILIES OF MISSINGS ARE GONNA COME RUSHING OUT HERE.
I'M GONNA NEED SOME UNIFORMED OFFICERS TO ASSIST ME.
COME ON, LET'S GET YOU SET UP.
MORGAN, I WANT YOU TO SUPERVISE THE EVIDENCE COLLECTION.
I DON'T THINK THE TECHS HAVE SEEN A SCENE LIKE THIS BEFORE.
HAS ANYONE? WE HAVE A PICTURE.
THIS IS LUCAS TURNER, MASON'S BROTHER.
ACCORDING TO MASON, HE'S THE UNSUB.
MASON CLAIMS HE'S A VICTIM HIMSELF.
DOES MASON KNOW WHERE LUCAS WOULD TAKE THE GIRL? CLAIMS HE HAS NO IDEA.
REID, LUCAS IS YOUR ASSIGNMENT.
FIND HIS ROOM, HIS THINGS, ANYTHING THAT MIGHT TELL US WHERE HE WOULD GO.
ON IT.
ONE MORE THING.
MASON WARNED ME THAT HIS BROTHER IS EXTREMELY PSYCHOTIC.
SAYS HE WON'T GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
PRENTISS, HAVE JJ GET THE PICTURE AND THE DESCRIPTION OUT TO THE PRESS.
WHEN THEY GET HERE, PUT THEM TO WORK FOR US.
SOMEBODY'S GONNA NOTICE A MAN THAT BIG.
YOU GOT IT.
DAVE.
ACCORDING TO MASON, MASON CLAIMS TO.
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM.
HE ALSO SAID WE SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO TALK TO HIS BROTHER.
WE SHOULD SHOOT FIRST.
WELL, THAT'S EITHER HELPFUL ADVICE OR A WAY FOR HALF A TEAM TO CLEAN UP LOOSE ENDS.
EITHER WAY, THIS IS SOME FAMILY.
[PIGS SQUEALING.]
[DOGS BARKING.]
IF YOU HAVE PHOTOS, I CAN TAKE THEM HERE.
WE HAVE POLICE OFFICERS THAT CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES.
ANDRE, THESE ARE THE UNSUB'S COVERALLS.
LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WASHED IN SOME TIME, SO IT SHOULD BE A GOOD SCENT SOURCE.
GOT IT.
YOUR WARRANT.
YOU CAN SEARCH ALL HIS FILES AND HARD DRIVES.
LET'S GO SERVE IT.
GREAT.
GARCIA FIND ME SOMETHING.
YES, SIR.
[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO.]
AGENT MORGAN.
YOU GOT HERE FAST.
DETROIT'S NOT THAT FAR.
DID YOU BRING THE CASE FILES? I GOT 35 OPEN MISSINGS.
THAT'S ALL? THAT'S NOT ENOUGH? SO FAR.
OHGOD.
I DON'T THINK GOD'S BEEN OUT HERE IN A LONG TIME.
HOW IS HE? HOW WOULD YOU BE? HE ASKED FOR HELP AND NOBODY EVER LOOKED FOR HIS SISTER.
WE DID THE BEST WE COULD.
IGNORING HIM WAS THE BEST YOU COULD DO? WE WERE UNDERMANNED.
WELL, THESE ARE JUST ALL THROWAWAY PEOPLE TO YOU ANYWAY, RIGHT? THAT IS NOT FAIR.
AGENT MORGAN! ISN'T IT? CAN YOU COME HERE, PLEASE? GRAB YOUR CASE FILES.
MASON SAYS HIS BROTHER SOMETIMES SLEEPS ON THE COUCH IN THE LIVING ROOM OR DISAPPEARS FOR DAYS AT A TIME.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A ROOM? NOT ACCORDING TO MASON.
KEEP LOOKING AROUND.
THEY'VE LIVED HERE THEIR WHOLE LIVES.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING HERE THAT GIVES US AN IDEA OF WHO HE IS.
THAT IS MY PERSONAL PROPERTY.
NOT ANYMORE.
I SHOWED YOU THE WARRANT.
I HAVE RESEARCH ON THERE.
PROPRIETARY RESEARCH.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
I HELPED YOU.
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW.
IF WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME IS YOUR TOTAL INVOLVEMENT, THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING ON THIS COMPUTER THAT YOU DON'T WANT US TO SEE.
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING, DAVE? NO.
ME AND MASON ARE HAVING A GREAT TIME.
AREN'T WE, MASON? ONCE I SAW MY BROTHER STRANGLE A MAN SO FORCEFULLY, BLOOD DRIPPED FROM HIS EYE SOCKETS.
[LABORED BREATHING.]
I'M NOT TALKING PETECHIA.
ACTUAL DRIPPING BLOOD.
HE CAN BE VERY VOLATILE WHEN THINGS DON'T GO HIS WAY.
ARE YOU TRYING TO SCARE ME? I'M JUST SAYING.
YOU BETTER HURRY UP AND FIND THAT GIRL, OR [LABORED BREATHING.]
HE'S GONNA TEAR HER TO PIECES.
[MUTTERING.]
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO IS SOMEONE SUPPOSED TO CALL YOU ON THAT PHONE? YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE IT.
I'M TRYING TO HELP.
MAYBE YOU DON'T GET SERVICE IN HERE.
ARE WE UNDERGROUND? WHAT? THE WALLS LOOK LIKE WE'RE UNDERGROUND.
IF WE ARE, YOUR PHONE PROBABLY WON'T WORK IN HERE.
WON'T WORK? NOT IF WE'RE UNDERGROUND.
[SQUEAKING.]
WILLIAM.
HAVE YOU FOUND SOMETHING? SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM.
BEFORE I WENT BACK OVER THERE, BEFORE I LOST MY WILLIAM, I'M REALLY SORRY.
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO GO BACK.
IT WAS LIKE SHE KNEW SOMETHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO HER.
HOTCH.
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
WHEN? I'M GONNA HOOK UP WITH PRENTISS AND THE SEARCH PARTY.
I--I CAN'T STAND AROUND HERE.
OK.
KEEP IN TOUCH.
IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO CALL YOU, THEY CAN'T.
HE ALWAYS CALLS.
I'M TELLING YOU, HE CAN'T.
HE ALWAYS CALLS! BUT IF THERE'S NO SERVICE, HE CAN'T.
REID? UP HERE.
HEY, I FOUND OUT WHERE HE SLEEPS.
SO MASON WAS LYING? I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE HE DIDN'T KNOW HIS BROTHER WAS LIVING IN THE BARN.
ANYTHING UP THERE THAT'S GONNA HELP US FIND HIM? NO, NOTHING YET.
I WILL SAY THIS, THOUGH-- I DOUBT THAT HE'S PSYCHOTIC.
WHY IS THAT? THERE'S A COLLECTION OF DRAWINGS UP HERE THAT SUGGEST AUTISM OR MODERATE MENTAL RETARDATION.
NOW, RETARDATION AND PSYCHOSIS IN THE EXACT SAME SUBJECT IS EXCEEDINGLY RARE.
IT'S MORE LIKELY HE DOESN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ACTS THAT HE'S COMMITTED.
ANYTHING TO SUGGEST A VIOLENT NATURE? NOTHING IN THE DRAWINGS.
THEY DO SUGGEST SOMEONE'S BEEN WATCHING HIM.
HE'S VERY CHILDLIKE.
I THINK THAT WHEN WE FIND HIM, HE'S GONNA BE SCARED AND PROBABLY CONFUSED.
YOU THINK HE'LL FIGHT? UH, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.
HEY, HOTCH.
DO YOU EVER GET THE FEELING THAT A CASE ISN'T GOING TO END WELL? REID, KEEP LOOKING.
THIS GIRL NEEDS US.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO OUTSIDE.
WHAT? AND WALK AROUND OUT THERE UNTIL YOU GET YOUR CALL.
NO.
YOU REALLY SHOULD GO.
AAH! HE'LL CALL ME! DON'T YOU SAY HE WON'T CALL ME! AAH! AAH! AAH! DON'T YOU SAY HE WON'T CALL ME! MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY! PLEASE! [SOBBING.]
HELP ME.
MOMMY? [SOBBING.]
I WANT TO GO.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
MOMMY! [SOBBING.]
YOU'VE BEEN WITH THIS TEAM WHAT, 2 YEARS, RIGHT? IT'S 7 FOR ME.
ALMOST 3 ALREADY.
I MEAN, THAT'S ALL I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALL DAY IS THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE BEEN WITH THE B.
A.
U.
, WORKING ALMOST NONSTOP, HAVING NO REAL LIFE, THESE BROTHERS HAVE BEEN OUT HERE KILLING 89 PEOPLE AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT.
WELL, WE KNOW NOW.
AND WE'LL MAKE THEM PAY.
BUT HOW MANY OTHERS ARE STILL OUT THERE, PRENTISS, HMM, HUNTING AND KILLING? I MEAN, THE THING IS, NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, NO MATTER HOW HARD WE WORK, NO MATTER HOW GOOD WE ARE AT WHAT WE DO, THIS IS NEVER GONNA END.
Man: COULD BE SOME MARKINGS UP AHEAD THERE.
Second man: AT THE TREE LINE? [DOGS BARKING.]
OHHHE MUST HAVE GONE IN THE WATER.
IF THE DOGS LOSE THAT SCENT, IT'S GONNA BE NOTHING BUT A NEEDLE IN A BIG OLD HAYSTACK.
MAYBE WE SHOULD SPLIT UP, TAKE EITHER SIDE OF THE STREAM.
HE MIGHT HAVE COME BACK OUT SOMEWHERE UP THERE.
AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE TO HANG OUT AT THAT DAMN PIG FARM, I'M GOOD.
OK, DEFENSE SYSTEM, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.
BANG--LIKE BERLIN-- ANOTHER WALL FALLS, THE WORLD OPENS UP.
THERE YOU ARE, INNER CORE.
CHANGE PASSWORD-- LET'S GO WITH OZ.
OH, I'M FEELING SO DOROTHY GALE TODAY.
AUNTIE EM WOULD BE SO PROUD [SOBBING.]
NO! ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
WHAT? UHMASMASON SAYS I ALWAYS GET MAD TOO HARD.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MY NAME IS KELLY.
MASON SAYS NEVER, NEV-NEVER NO NAMES.
DOESN'T MASON WANT US TO BE FRIENDS? FRIENDS? GARCIA? THEY WERE DOING EXPERIMENTS.
EXPERIMENTS? UNSUCCESSFUL ONES.
HE TRIED TO FIX HIMSELF.
WOULD IT BE BETTER IF IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING? THEY WERE HUMAN BEINGS.
THEY WERE TRANSIENTS AND DRUG USERS AND PROSTITUTES.
THEY WERE USELESS TO SOCIETY.
I GAVE THEM THE CHANCE TO BE PART OF A CURE.
TO BE OF USE.
BUT THAT'S-- THAT'S SCIENCE.
NO, IT ISN'T.
SO YOU GOT SOME INFORMATION OFF MY LAPTOP.
SO WHAT? WHAT JURY'S GONNA BELIEVE I HAD THE POWER TO KILL ANYONE? I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MOVE FROM THE NECK DOWN FOR 7 YEARS.
EVEN IF YOU COULD CONVICT ME OF SOMETHING WHAT PUNISHMENT COULD BE WORSE THAN THE LIFE I ALREADY LEAD? FIND MY IDIOT BROTHER.
EXACT YOUR POUND OF FLESH AND LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE.
NO.
IT'S OK.
YOU CAN TELL ME YOUR NAME.
LU-LUCAS.
THAT'S A NICE NAME.
A VERY NICE NAME.
DO YOU HAVE ANY FOOD, LUCAS? FOOD? I'M HUNGRY.
I THREW UP ALL MY FOOD WHEN I WAS SICK.
I REALLY NEED SOME FOOD.
OK.
OH, NO.
WAIT.
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TIE ME UP, LUCAS.
M-MASON SAYS ALWAYS.
MASON DOESN'T WANT US TO BE FRIENDS, REMEMBER? YOU DON'T HAVE TO TIE ME UP, LUCAS.
THAT'S HOW FRIENDS ACT.
I REALLY NEED SOME FOOD.
OK.
THEY WERE DOING EXPERIMENTS.
Reid: SPINAL REGENERATION? PROBABLY.
HE WAS DEFINITELY TRYING TO FIX HIMSELF.
STEM CELL HARVESTING? THE EQUIPMENT'S FAR TOO UNSOPHISTICATED.
THERE'S NO WAY IT WOULD HAVE EVER WORKED.
YOU WERE A PROSECUTOR, HOTCH.
COULD YOU CONVICT THIS GUY? A QUADRIPLEGIC WHO CLEARLY NEVER TOUCHED ANY OF THE VICTIMS? I DON'T KNOW.
WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON KELLY.
WE CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THE OTHER STUFF RIGHT NOW.
HE MIGHT GET AWAY WITH THIS.
[GASPING AND CRYING.]
[SOBBING.]
NO-- [PANTING AND CRYING.]
NO! [BRANCH SNAPS.]
PRENTISS, I GOT SOMEONE SNEAKING AROUND ABOUT 30 YARDS AHEAD OF ME.
COPY THAT.
[CRYING.]
NO! FBI! DO NOT MOVE! [GASPS.]
[CRYING.]
BERRIES.
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? I'M SORRY, MR.
LANG.
CAN I GO? UH, NOT YET, SIR.
UMHAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN? THAT'S LUCAS TURNER.
YOU KNOW HIM.
OH, EVERYBODY KNOWS LUCAS.
HE'S--HE'S A LITTLE SOFT IN THE HEAD.
YOU GUYS WAIT AROUND LONG ENOUGH, HE'LL WANDER BACK HOME.
CAN I GO? YES, SIR.
THANK YOU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S IN THAT BAG? I'M PRETTY SURE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
THESE ARE DELICIOUS, LUCAS.
COULD I HAVE SOME WATER? I HAVE WATER.
COULD I HAVE SOME? THIS IS A NICE HOUSE YOU HAVE, LUCAS.
TH--UH THIS IS NOT A HOUSE.
THE--THE FARM IS OUR HOUSE.
WHAT IS THIS, THEN? IT'S FOR WHERE WE DO HUNTING.
ME--ME AND MY DAD AND MY BROTHER BUILT IT.
BUT THEN HE DIED.
YOUR BROTHER DIED? WHAT? YOU SAID-- MASON DIDN'T DIE.
HE FELL FROM THE BARN, BUT HE DIDN'T DIE.
IT'S OK.
I'M SORRY, LUCAS.
I TAKE--I TAKE CARE OF HIM.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I JUST MADE A MISTAKE.
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T PUSH HIM.
I DIDN'T PUSH MASON OFF THE BARN.
HOW DID YOU GET HURT? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? NONE, I GUESS.
MY BROTHER PUSHED ME OUT OF THE LOFT.
I WANTED TO SELL THE FARM.
I HAD JUST FINISHED MEDICAL SCHOOL.
IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME A NICE DOWN PAYMENT ON A PRACTICE IN THE CITY.
BUT THE FARM WAS ALL HE KNEW.
LUCAS DOESN'T HANDLE ANGRY WELL.
IS THAT WHY YOU HATE HIM? HATE HIM? HE'S DONE NOTHING BUT TAKE CARE OF ME EVERY DAY SINCE THEN.
YOU SAID NOT TO EVEN TRY TALKING TO HIM IF WE FIND HIM.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT US TO KILL HIM.
BUT THAT'S NOT HATE.
THAT'S A FAVOR.
MY BROTHER COULDN'T SURVIVE WITHOUT ME.
LUCAS? LUCAS, I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
I HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, PEE.
OH.
OH, WELL NO, I CAN'T.
THERE'S A BUCKET.
NOT IN A BUCKET.
THERE'S A BUCKET.
LUCAS, THAT'S OK FOR ALL OF YOU BOYS, BUT I'M A GIRL.
I NEED PRIVACY.
YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO OUTSIDE.
BUT THERE'S A BUCKET.
IT'S OK.
WE'RE FRIENDS.
FRIEND? OK.
OK.
[BEEPING.]
[DOOR OPENS.]
ANYTHING ELSE? NOTHING THAT'LL HELP FIND HIS BROTHER.
THERE'S A CELL PHONE HE CALLS DOZENS OF TIMES A DAY, BUT THAT APPEARS TO BE OFF.
AND I TRIED TO ACTIVATE THE GPS LOCATOR ON IT, BUT I THINK IT'S AN OLD PHONE, SO THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK EITHER.
WILL YOU KNOW IF IT COMES ON? I HOPE SO.
YES, SIR.
KEEP AT IT.
OK, I--I CAN GO FROM HERE.
GO? NO, I'M NOT LEAVING, LUCAS.
I JUST NEED SOME PRIVACY.
YOU WAIT OVER THERE, LUCAS BY THE DOOR.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OK.
IT'S OK.
FURTHER.
FURTHER.
FURTHER.
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? JUST WAITING FOR-- OH, MY GOD.
THE PHONE JUST TURNED BACK ON.
WHAT? NO.
KELLY! ALMOST DONE.
STAY THERE, LUCAS.
[BEEP BEEP.]
KELLY! OH, MY GOD.
AGENT ROSSI, THE PHONE IS CALLING IN! [RINGING.]
HELLO? HELLO? MY NAME IS KELLY.
KELLY, THIS IS PENELOPE GARCIA.
I'M WITH THE FBI.
OH, MY GOD, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.
I'M SOMEWHERE IN THE WOODS BEING HELD BY A MAN NAMED LUCAS, AND HE KEL-KELLY? AND HE'S--OH, MY GOD! HELP ME! Lucas: THAT'S MINE! OH, MY GOD! PLEASE-- [LINE DISCONNECTS.]
THE PHONE'S DISCONNECTED.
GARCIA, CAN YOU FIND THE SIGNAL? NO, I--WAIT.
YES.
I'M HOOKED INTO THE SYSTEM.
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO-- GOT IT.
IT'S JUST WEST OF HERE, LESS THAN HALF A MILE.
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN TELL? IT'S IN THE WOODS.
THERE AREN'T ANY REFERENCE POINTS.
GET THE COORDINATES TO MY GPS AND LET MORGAN AND PRENTISS KNOW IN THE FIELD.
DAVE, REID, LET'S GO.
MOMMY, DON'T! UHH! UHH! UHH! THE FBI IS COMING! MASON SAYS EVERYONE ALWAYS LIES! ALWAYS! YOU LIED! ALWAYS-- LET ME GO, YOU FREAK! UHH! [SOBBING.]
ALMOST THERE.
A COUPLE HUNDRED YARDS.
SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE.
[CRYING.]
NOT A FREAK.
LUCAS.
LUCAS, I'M SORRY.
SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS WHERE THE SIGNAL CAME FROM.
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.
KELLY! [CRYING.]
Prentiss: KELLY! I--I PUSHED HIM.
I PUSHED HIM.
LUCAS.
I--I PUSHED HIM OFF THE BARN.
IT WAS ME.
I DID IT.
SOMETIMES I GET SO MAD I GET BAD MAD.
LUCAS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
BAD, BAD MAD.
KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! WE'RE IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT SPOT.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY SPLIT UP.
KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! KELLY! KELLY? GUYS.
I'M A FREAK.
YOU ARE NOT A FREAK.
I'M A FREAK.
GO AHEAD.
KELLY SHANE? DOWN HERE! DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES WHEN THEY COME DOWN, OK? I'M BAD.
I'M BAD.
LUCAS TURNER, THIS IS THE FBI.
JUST PUT YOUR HANDS UP, OK? [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE.]
Hotch: SOMETIMES THERE ARE NO WORDS, NO CLEVER QUOTES TO NEATLY SUM UP WHAT'S HAPPENED THAT DAY.
SOMETIMES YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT, EVERYTHING EXACTLY RIGHT, AND STILL YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE FAILED.
DID IT NEED TO END THAT WAY? COULD SOMETHING HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT THE TRAGEDY IN THE FIRST PLACE? THE DEATHS OF MASON AND LUCAS TURNER MAKE 91 LIVES SNUFFED OUT.
KELLY SHANE WILL GO HOME AND TRY TO RECOVER, TO RECONNECT WITH HER FAMILY, BUT SHE'LL NEVER BE A CHILD AGAIN.
WILLIAM HIGHTOWER, WHO GAVE HIS LEG FOR HIS COUNTRY, GAVE THE REST OF HIMSELF TO AVENGE HIS SISTER'S MURDER.
THAT MAKES 93 LIVES FOREVER ALTERED, NOT COUNTING FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN A SMALL TOWN IN SARNIA, ONTARIO, WHO THOUGHT MONSTERS DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL THEY LEARNED THAT THEY SPENT THEIR LIVES WITH ONE.
AND WHAT ABOUT MY TEAM? HOW MANY MORE TIMES WILL THEY BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO THE ABYSS? HOW MANY MORE TIMES BEFORE THEY WON'T EVER RECOVER THE PIECES OF THEMSELVES THAT THIS JOB TAKES? [CLICK.]
LIKE I SAID, SOMETIMES THERE ARE NO WORDS, NO CLEVER QUOTES TO NEATLY SUM UP WHAT'S HAPPENED THAT DAY.
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE A DEAL.
SOMETIMES THE DAY JUST [GUNSHOT.]
ENDS.
